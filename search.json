    "text": "The tone of this essay is emotional, untethered, free from any format constraint. It has no destination but the message itself.\nTo pursue knowledge is to honor the gift of life. From our mothers to our ancestors, all of them, we owe it, to the past, ad continuum.\nIn the year 2023, in the christian time-stamp, we live in a period where wonder decayed into pessimism. Some would argue that this pessimism is a fruit directly ripped from the knowledge we seek, “perhaps we man are evil beings”, “a virus we are”.\nI strongly disagree, we are not evil, but ignorant.\nWe may think that we have far past the dark ages of mysticism, but the enlightenment wasn’t any cure for this malady that affects this global civilization.\nIgnorance, and only that. To attribute morality to natural objects is a clear indication that we, as Humans, have not entertained the connection between ourselves and all the other life-scales.\nFor now, we still haven’t perceived that life is a continuum, on which we are its part and agency. Not only Nature has birthed us, but has incumbent on us the majestic responsibility to act on its behalf.\nWe surely are not doing justice in this delegation of agency, perhaps because man chooses to oblivion, and dismisses the underlying mechanism, the logic behind agency in natural processes.\nMen and their perception need to identify the breadcrumbs left by our Mother, we are not a single thread, detached, checked out, the fruit of random causation.\nThere seems to be no evidence supporting randomness in natural iterative design, only a scope of possibilities given a certain state of constraints, future agency by exploratory and combinatorial means.\nWhat if we were to rejoice in the wonder? To achieve constructivism, we must first admit defeat.\nIgnorance is a blank page on a notebook, where we can shape the immaterial manifestation of all the mothers and the fathers, the seeds of knowledge leading to observations, sense-making, discovery and emergence.\nLet us put down the distractions, reject conformity and think. What we came to name “the mind” is an evolutionary device that has been developing since the beginning of life-time.\nLife-time seems to be a continuum, the stage where life is assembled by building blocks driven by potential, where actors of molecular intelligence, memory at the smallest scale, and atomic units of agency, lead to larger systems at play in the interconnectedness of all there is.\nIn the scenario of the above proposed, it is understandable our ignorance, and condemnation is easy but not useful.\n[unfinished] Porto, Portugal, 05:30 am"

    "text": "Information, depending on the field of study, takes different meanings or encompasses a different set of attributes.\nIs it possible to formulate a generalized definition for Information? The question, although simple at first glance, has by design the term possibility, an open invitation to ask:\nWhat if it is not possible, because Information is just an axis on a dimensional space to which we don’t have access? Is information metamorphic, does it have a continuum, or does it belong in a spectrum?\nThere is no ambition in my words to dissect all the lexicons and references to provide multiple transcripts of publications. This exploration of Information is an exercise in synergetic analysis, guided by a non formal intuition of an underlying broader symbolic relationship.\nWhy is it usefull to question something so robust as the current definitions and the distinction between Information Theories?\nAre there possibilities to further strech it and find new fittings?\nIf the discovery of information is proved, how could it change out understanding of reality? Could missinformation become a crime? If we are not the true destination of infomration, what else is in the realm of and qualifies an observer? Even if nothing of value comes out of this, the model will not suffer when questioned, would only solidify it’s significace.\nIn my day to day I’m constantly reminded of Shannon’s Information Theory, and as starting point let’s take the axioms of the Mathematical Theory of Communication:"

    "text": "We experience education in sequential steps, closed and determined, are given information and instructions within a perspective of the immutability of reality. “Always was, always will be”, sets a stage from where social order re-establishes itself for yet another generation.\nCurrently, education is given a high degree of importance, addressing three major domains:\n\nparalleled with some future economic value\nparamount for better future societies\nfor an x% increase amount of life-expectancy\n\nAmongst the immutability illusion, the doctrine of stability hinders and is dangerously close to the actual and permanent elimination of the core evolutionary device Humans have called learning ability.\nOf course, modernity and the Industrial Revolution required literate workers to read the manuals, efficiently operate the machines, and assemble products, ensuring the life expectancy of the growing assembly line. Before that, old clerics required new ones, creating literate minds to perpetuate the dogmatic pillars of societies.\nThese processes worked irrefutably then, and now, for a pair of decades, after two generations into the Industrial era, two wars eradicated the contextual roots that led to the newfound modernity, within the space-time continuum of existence.\nA beginning was forged, and the past obliviated.\nSo, what we have is the ‘life or death’ decision to, no matter at what cost, participate in the system that produces a panoply of static socio-economic engines.\nGiven that formal education eradicates the why question from the equations, and there is a hungry mob of militants enforcing procedures and methods as doctrines, the addition of the life or death term, Educational institutions appear to be very effective at their crucial role in Humanity’s self-destruction.\nIt’s understandable if you disagree, but entertain the thought for a moment, what supports the argument won’t take long to pass across, and does the reader have anything to lose?\n\nArgument\nWe are information processing systems, not machines, but systems, of systems of several degrees of agency. There are fantastical and mesmerizing processes of intra-systemic communication, and collaboration that address all scales and allow us to breathe out of our conscious decision stage.\n“Ah, that is just physics”, say most institutions.\n\n\n\nAltText\n\n\nLevin, M. Bioelectric networks: the cognitive glue enabling evolutionary scaling from physiology to mind. Anim Cogn 26, 1865–1891 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-023-01780-3\nSo far, the argument is, that “Education is essential for”\n\nsome future economic value\nsomehow better future societies\nx% increase amount of life-expectancy\n\nBy:\n\nRemoving doubt, the why question, from a very young age, ensuring the replication of social order and forging the tacit agreements on fundamental truths for the next generation to come\nTeaching complex systems to repeat the same static methods and externalizing processes, regardless of their dynamic nature\nPromising those who adhere with dedication, and precision to the set of static methodologies, a vague idea of prosperity, health and wealth\n\nOf course, the argument is not fully complete, but is important to juxtapose the information and lay the concurrent principles.\nIt is important to say at this point, that I do not argue that education is bad, nor am I defending illiteracy, child mortality and poverty. The argument defends Education at its root, the why of which education itself exists, sets the tone for further analysis on the meaning propelling this perversion, leading to the institutionalization of what once was considered a duty, and is now turning it into a privilege, for the privilege of being able to exercise it.\nTransferring the information gathered to new generations, to optimize the learning process across long periods, inter-generational learning one may call it, it seems to be an evolutionary mechanism developed to prevent extinction, as most life forms on our planet contain. Most species do it in ways we haven’t been able to decode, as each system is limited by its perceptual range.\nRecapping, our education system:\nEducation is essential for:\n\nsome future economic value\nbetter future societies\nx% increase amount of life-expectancy\n\nBy:\n\nRemoving doubt, the why, from a very young age, ensuring social order and forging tacit agreements of fundamental truths\nTeaching complex systems to repeat the same methods and processes on the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the universe\nPromissing those who adhere with dedication and precision and hypothetical better future, based on static doctrines and inductive biases.\nBeing accessible exclusively for a discriminatory and deficient assessment of human potential\nUsed as an ordering power weapon\nObscuring and obstructing knowledge\nProprietary\n\nEvolution has its selection method, beyond Darwin’s linearity. Humans decided to implement Educational systems in place that select who are the fittest by the wrong criteria, hindering the evolutionary process at its core, reducing its agency to -1 device, which took millions of years to evolve.\nHumans did it in 100 years.\nIt’s unfathomable that we didn’t conceive seriously, at any period, that we know of, to question the nature of learning, why do we learn?\nI’m not an expert (break, to be continued )"
