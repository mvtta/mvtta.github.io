    "text": "Preface\n\n“This most of all: ask yourself in the most silent hour of your night: must I write? Dig into yourself for a deep answer. And if this answer rings out in assent, if you meet this solemn question with a strong, simple -I must-, then build your life in accordance with this necessity; your whole life, even into its humblest and most indifferent hour, must become a sign and witness to this impulse.” Reiner Maria Rilke\n\nIn embarking on this project, I found myself drawn to this question “What is agency?” which has fascinated many great thinkers across centuries and cultures. This question is deceptively simple yet profoundly complex, touching on the essence of action, interaction, causality, intention, and the organisation of systems ranging from cells to societies. My goal, initially, was to explore agency through various lenses, and look for binding principles across scales. As I developed some understanding, it struck me, not only were there points of convergence in how different disciplines understood agency as agency itself connected these disparate fields of study.\nI related how Aristotle’s concept of the “efficient cause” the agent or process that brings about change had a surprising resonance with D’Arcy Thompson’s work. In Thompson’s view, physical forces like gravity, surface tension, and pressure act as efficient causes, shaping the forms of living organisms. While Aristotle might have attributed these forms to a more teleological purpose, Thompson showed how physical laws could drive the development of complex structures, and these could be beautifully expressed through mathematics. Thompson’s exploration of forces acting on biological forms as identifying the physical efficient causes that structure life, seems quite relevant because in more modern terms we can consider physical forces as fundamental interactions. The study of the emergence of life tries to bridge with an understanding of how from those interactions complex life can emerge and self-organize.\nThat connection between efficient causes and the forces shaping the world felt/feel deeply significant, and continues to be relevant when delving into how forces that shape nature translate into self-organization. Observations related to order, scales and organisation are in turn connected to open questions of the origin of life, morphogenesis, and other forms of “becoming” of the world and into the world. Once “here”, things interact, predictions are made upon behaviors that seem determined by their nature and the laws that govern “everything”. Modern questions of causal theories and fundamental physics ask: How do interactions between fundamental particles lead to the emergence of complex structures and behaviors? What role does information play in shaping these processes? How can we understand causality at different levels of organization, from the quantum realm to the macroscopic world?\nThe relevance that these perspectives have in today’s research and governance practices was a compelling drive for this huge endeavor (I voluntarily) signed up for. After all, there is a dissonance in the apparent laws that govern things and the laws that Human societies use to organise and collaborate. Could deeper insights or even interpretations of the first help us address some of the challenges the second face?\nThere are many parallels and analogies drawn from physics to other fields of inquiry. There are also several reasonable arguments for the dissonance between the laws we call natural, and the ones we make. Put simply, they are different things, but are they? While the mystery of life and existence remains as is, living and non-living systems are composed of nested levels of organization, and while the fundamental level of reality is still in question, without a doubt the policies we make affect the reality we perceive, individually and collectively. Not just ours, but of all entities embedded in our environment, which some are so small we forget they too are embedded entities in their own environments. Environments which are made up of things that we change, build upon and draw from.\nAcross these hierarchies of how things become things by organised clumps of matter, observations tell us that from the very simple to the increasingly complex things interact, and from unorganised to orderly, and to decay things across scales exhibit “inter-active” properties. From light that bends to a gesture of affection, to forms of communication to how information flows, to homeostatic cycles, babies, trees, and seasons.\nThese influences, diverse as they are, coalesced into a hypothesis that agency was far more widespread and adaptable than I had ever imagined: regardless of any degrees of intelligence, composition or origin, what dictates relationships could shape a new understanding for relating.\nCould agency and interaction be part of something hidden in plain sight?\nOur senses may not tell us entirely what reality is, but from interdisciplinary experimental evidence to theoretical foundations, we can explore how agency and interaction relate. In pursuit of an explanation for why things interact, implies the assumption that some form of enabling devices for the such could be recognisable, allowing connections, which if true, their understanding could improve our knowledge of design principles for thriving across scales.\nThis required a shift in perspective, one that takes hyper-specialised notions within these scales to across them, and instead of getting bogged down in arguments on how they may differ, we should instead look towards all the notions and see if they ”dance”.\nOn a practical note, this study touches responsibility: We live on a planet with finite resources, a closed system. This reality demands that we think carefully about how we organize ourselves, how we design our cities, and how we develop new technologies.\nIt’s no longer enough to ask, “Does this work?”, instead we can ask, “Does this contribute to the long-term thriving of the whole system?”. It requires recognising that not all systems are necessarily optimized for some goal, and that it may be hard for us to even recognise goals in settings different from our own, but opening up to the possibility that we may be dismissing popular ideas on the interconnectedness of all things, and that is our ignorance preventing us from working towards some kind of harmony.\nThis relational perspective on agency has the potential to shift our understanding and practices to a truly integrated one supporting the natural world, and us in it.\nI see this book as a starting point for conversations that reach across disciplines, where philosophers, scientists, artists, policymakers, and citizens come together to explore the meaning of agency.\nUnder the assumption that everything impacts everything else, what if we could allow man-made systems to be aware of it? Whether those systems are cities, technologies, or policies, we might be ensuring that their next generations, artificial or otherwise, are by design built for co-evolution.\nWhile this has not always been the case, and the universe seems to be old, dangerous and weird, it also seems that systems that work together, become more than some of their parts, they persist, giving novel phenomena a chance to be.\nWhile the assumptions can be objectionable, I would like to use the gift of my brief life and the available means to explore this. As many came before me, and could not continue their work, as I hope when I’m no longer, some will also care for relationships, and be in absolute awe of the beauty our senses allows, moved by pain and curiosity, and held together by immense levels of collaboration, cooperation and remains open to the possibility that the awareness of it may have a scientific explanation.\nAs such, this book represents two years of exploration a journey through approximately 500 articles spanning philosophy, biology, artificial intelligence, sociology, and more. It has been both daunting and transformative. Along the way, I’ve come to appreciate not only the richness of the existing body of knowledge but also the gaps that remain between its parts.\nAs you read through these pages, I invite you to join me with an open mind, to explore new possibilities for understanding agency.\nTogether, we might uncover insights that not only deepen our knowledge but also help us build better relationships with one another, with our environments, and with the systems we create."

Bottlenecks and pain-points are popular expressions that concern a general idea: Problems. And what can you do with problems? Fix them. Solving one issue versus solving the problem seems to be the main pitfall companies developing AI and tech products, because while it keeps teams busy and immediate rewards of resolving small issues, the architectural problem may not be addressed, and if they were, solving one problem could potentially resolve n more issues.\nWhile architectural problems are of interested, they deserve an entire article (or several) to address them in more detail. For now, we may focus on one tangible questions that most (a range of technical and general audiences) can follow and leverage from the information here shared:\nWhat efforts are in place to address existing issues?\n\n\n\nIf we perceive the flow of information and processes through the pipeline as a signal, a phone call, it’s easy to intuit how it is naturally prone to errors, loss, miss-calculations and interferences in the process. Most of us know what is the Telephone game, or the Whispers game, where “which messages are whispered from person to person and then the original and final messages are compared.”. Now imagine that everyone involved is dedicated to really passing the message accurately, but since they speak different languages, this will have a degree of on influence on how the message will be transmitted.\nFor decades, and actually very important in actual phone-calls are error correction codes, and they are widely used in software development as well.\nThe concepts of error correction codes, Hamming codes, and hashing in AI/ML, have shared origins with information theory, and although a broad and historically rich research topics, and in spite their complexity, conceptually they are simple to gain some initial intuition on:\nImagine error correction codes as a protective shield or a self-healing fabric wrapped around data (or the message of the Telephone Game analogy above). Just as a self-healing material can repair small tears or damages, error correction codes allow data to recover from minor corruptions during transmission, or even aid the encoder fill in the gaps if data is missing. Hamming codes, in this analogy, are like a specialized patch on this fabric, designed to detect and mend specific types of tears efficiently.\nThis allows us to consider how error correction techniques play a significant role in speeding up input / output operations, feature retrieval and optimize memory usage.\nHashing, on the other hand, can be viewed as a form of data compression or approximation. It’s akin to creating a thumbnail of an image, how much information is necessary to be passed around? A smaller representation that captures the essence of the original sometimes is enough. A smiley face emoji does not need to be yellow if the intent is to answer is it smiling? : yes or no?\nIn traditional computing, this thumbnail aims for uniqueness, like a fingerprint. But in AI/ML applications, it’s more like an impressionist painting, capturing the semantic essence rather than exact details.\nThe evolution of these concepts in AI/ML, particularly in cross-modal hashing and joint Hamming spaces, is like creating a universal language or a common currency for different types of information. It’s as if we’re translating diverse data types: text, images, audio; into a shared alphabet, where similarities can be easily compared regardless of their original form.\nAll these techniques, at their core, are about efficient representation and manipulation of information. They share a common ancestry in information theory and the fundamental challenge of encoding, transmitting, and decoding data accurately and efficiently. Whether it’s protecting against errors, creating compact representations, or enabling cross-modal comparisons, these methods are different expressions of the same underlying principle: finding optimal ways to handle and process information in a world of imperfect channels, biases, and diverse data types.\nIn this shared universe analogy, for specialized and customized models, the range of data is somehow related. Visual culture has eras, styles etc. Thus, the Hamming distance of “A woman riding a horse on a prairie” and a “Woman sitting on a porch chair” if the model is specialized in Renascence paintings generation, is small, and their corresponding binary codes shall be small too (Chen et al. 2024b).

Recent work on motion capture and transposition, such as ByteDance’s Magic Avatar, demonstrates the ability to generate synthetic AI video with transposed actors and environments (ByteDance, 2023). Coupled with advancements in 3D environment reconstruction, like NVIDIA’s Neuralangelo could contribute to more realistic movement generation(Xiangli et al. 2023), We think we may be on the cusp of some really exciting breakthroughs in generating realistic motion and interactions.\n\nXiangli, Y., L.

The core idea is for the software to be bound to a container, and this container be intrinsically related to the software, where the feedback mechanisms, we discussed above, loop between one adn the other passing information of internal states and the surroundings. New sensing mechanisms and protocol design must then be developed, improves and optimized.\nAs we look towards the future of AI and ML, particularly in the realm of image generation and embodied intelligence, we find ourselves at the cusp of a paradigm shift. The mortal computation thesis, coupled with advancements in cross-modal hashing, error correction, and biomimetic approaches, presents exciting possibilities for more efficient, adaptable, and biologically-inspired AI systems.\nThe integration of concepts like the Free Energy Principle and circular causality from cybernetics into AI architectures could lead to significant breakthroughs in how machines process information and interact with their environment.

There’s no shortage of fascinating areas to explore, and the scenarios we will shortly live and whiteness are completely unforeseen. Some questions that seem worth thinking about are for example “What is the potential for high photorealism and personalization in avatars to lead to stronger embodiment and self-identification in virtual environments of Humans, and how will that impact the way we relate to each other and our non-virtual environment?”, and “How will societies evolver, adapt and integrate their cultural identities, having these new domains of interaction at the peer-relations level, and new means of individual self-expression?”. Moreover, we may ask: “What kind of new necessities will rise?”, “How will this new environment shape future generations into a new stage of Human Evolution?”, and “What kind of safe guards we can design for ourselves, to ensure that what we hold as valuable now, will persist in the future?”\nFor any kind of new system we create, given the shared meta-substrate: a closed planetary system called Earth, it seems quite reasonable in design principles that align shared constraints and necessities.\nAdditionally, intuition tells me that when striving for literacy at all levels of society and the continuous encouragement by facilitating the access to information and knowledge, is paramount. The reverse is a then the choice of alienating some, and deliberately incapacitating democracies, thus impacting policy-making, governance and constituting an obstruction to constructive debates and participatory politics.\nMoreover, as science and information become more complex, more specialized, a similar effort in bridging topics, simplifying language and streamlining the learning curve towards a panoramic understanding of the current knowledge map, seems, again, a sensible and tangible course of action towards current and future assurance of sense-making.\nIn conclusion, while it’s not easy to predict exactly where these developments will lead us, or if they will happen at all, neither vehemently subscribe to any idea in particular, thinking about the present and envisioning the future scope of possibilities helps us design the tomorrow we want to live in. In such, this series of opinion articles aim just that, informally and accessibly, to the best of my abilities, expose some ideas, transversely and across fields of inquiry. The future of AI and ML is not just about technological advancement, but about re-imagining the very nature of intelligence, computation, ecosystems, societies and life.

    "text": "Notes on Intelligence for the ‘AI’ Era\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe aim is to draft an informal overview of recent developments in research efforts tied to intelligence, paralleled with the undergoing and pivotal social, techno and ecological shift in the artificial intelligence age. Standing at the cusp of a new era for disciplines, the internet, knowledge, and humans, it seems pertinent to examine the convergence of various takes on intelligence - from computer science to biology, neuroscience, philosophy, and even cybernetics - so that knowingly we may shape the tools of today into the world and systems of tomorrow. This is a open note, and a work in progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Introduction\n\n“What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.” - Aristotle\n\nWe begin with some apropos foundational concepts, and distinctions relating to intelligence. As per convention, we first must propose a working definition for it. What is intelligence? There are many proposals (Legg and Hutter 2007) and a few certainties, thus, it is truly important to recognize that as for now, we do not have a single definition for it. While intelligent individuals may simply smile if prompted with the such question, it is nonetheless relevant the attempt to have a functional, and empirically tractable answer to it, one suiting the necessary perspective when addressing across domains. In practice, having a working definition of intelligence means exercising the bridge that connects theory to observations and from biological to engineered scopes one that allows us to make predictions towards potentially more effective relational strategies, and closer to the bottom of its meaning.\n\nChalmers, David J. 1996. “Facing up to the Problem of Consciousness.” Https://Consc.net/Papers/Facing.pdf.\nSomething may be perceived as intelligent, but is the awareness of such intelligence by said thing a determinant of it? The arguable ambiguity between intelligence and self-awareness point to open questions in our understanding of cognition and even the hard problem of consciousness(Chalmers 1996).\nThe difficulty in defining intelligence is not merely a semantic one, as it reflects this concept’s multidimensional nature. When asked to define intelligence, two dozen prominent theorists provided two dozen somewhat different definitions(Neisser 1996), which isn’t in itself a failure in defining it, neither it is a matter deemed to be forever open to interpretation. Rather, it seems to be evidence that no matter how lightly we may use the term intelligence namely in artificial intelligence, we do it, even if not fully aware or its meaning, or in agreement of what it means. The are several semantic cases of this nature, and it does not impede conveying the idea of intelligence or any idea intelligently.\nThe misconception of intelligence referring to human-only or human-like abilities such as self-awareness or reason is intriguingly informative of a deeper insight of the relationship a thing has to itself, it’s identity, to what differs from it.\nWhen intelligence is broadly conceptualized as the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills(Neisser 1996), there’s an implicit extension to adapt effectively to the environment, and learn from experience. Here said entity must have some sort of embodiment, one that allows for a dual relationship with it’s internal states and external events. In computational contexts, intelligence is then related to goal-directed behavior(Duncan et al. 1996), where something acts so as to maximize performance towards a goal or task, which is based on past experience. Conversely, conventional methods to access intelligence coefficients in Humans, regardless of arguments in their efficiency, contradict the premise (Ree and Earles 1998), as higher scores have not been found to translate systematically in job performance (Steel and Fariborzi 2024). Yet, as an information processing capability, a useful working and general definition may be intelligence as the competency to achieve goals / solve problems in a given space [Legg and Hutter (2007)](Michael Levin 2021)[^1]. [^1]: I should expand this at some point to include material, formal, ideal, structural and post structural debates\n\nNeisser, Gwyneth; Bouchard, Ulrich; Boodoo. 1996. “Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns.” American Psychological Association 51 (2): 77–101. https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.51.2.77.\n\nDuncan, J., H. Emslie, P. Williams, R. Johnson, and C. Freer. 1996. “Intelligence and the Frontal Lobe: The Organization of Goal-Directed Behavior.” Cognitive Psychology 30 (3): 257–303.\n\nRee, Malcolm James, and James A. Earles. 1998. “Intelligence Is the Best Predictor of Job Performance.” Personnel Psychology 1 (3): 431–42. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-6570.1998.tb00770.x.\n\nSteel, Piers, and Hadi Fariborzi. 2024. “A Longitudinal Meta-Analysis of Range Restriction Estimates and General Mental Ability Validity Coefficients: Better Addressing Overcorrection Amid Decline Effects.” Intelligence 88: 101703.\n\nLegg, Shane, and Marcus Hutter. 2007. “A Collection of Definitions of Intelligence.” arXiv Preprint arXiv:0706.3639.\n\nLevin, Michael. 2021. “Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere (TAME): An Experimentally-Grounded Framework for Understanding Diverse Bodies and Minds.” Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience 15: 709301.\nThis perspective allows us to recognize various forms of intelligence across species and systems. An interdisciplinary approach seems relevant here precisely because while single discipline may offer many perspectives, across disciplines the fragmentation and ambiguity hinder any chance of consensus.While the study of intelligence across humans, animals, and artificial systems reveals similarities and profound differences, looking at intelligence as a competency spectrum with expression in multi-dimensional spaces, places the ability to acquire, process, and apply information to achieve goals, adapt to environments, and problem-solving as mere manifestations of said expression. Here, we understand spaces as including physical, transcriptional, anatomical, physiological, and other abstract domains, combining Legg and Hutter’s (Legg and Hutter 2007) survey of intelligence definitions with Michael Levin’s developmental and biological perspective (Michael Levin 2021).\nIn regards to competency expression, we may be still tied to the limitations our own competencies allow us to observe, however it also offers the possibility through this framing to develop new means to expand our competencies, the same way we’ve developed tools to see beyond the spectrum of visible light. In this context, the hypothesis of an interdisciplinary and meta-entity Turing test could assess intelligence through a lens that transcends anthropomorphic mimicry. Traditional Turing tests focus on linguistic deception: “Can a machine imitate human conversation?” Yet this approach, while historically pivotal, needs some adjustments to address a competency-based intelligence understanding. A meta-entity Turing test would instead evaluate how systems recognize and interact with intelligence across domains, and allow competency mapping of problem-solving in physical, transcriptional, or abstract spaces (e.g., optimizing metabolic pathways, or negotiating ethical dilemmas). When slime molds exhibit problem-solving competency through gradient navigation and resource optimization(Reid et al. 2012), and systems like [[AlphaFold demonstrate competency in protein-folding spaces(Jumper et al. 2024)previously considered exclusive to evolutionary processes challenging traditional notions of problem-solving and adaptability in temporal scales(Michael Levin and Martyniuk 2024), while the later have been said “aware but not conscious”(Wang 2023), where does the first one stand?\n\nReid, C. R., T. Latty, A. Dussutour, and M. Beekman. 2012. “Slime Mold Uses Externalized Spatial ‘Memory’ to Navigate in Complex Environments.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 109 (43): 17490–94. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1215037109.\n\nJumper, John M. et al. 2024. “Accurate Structure Prediction of Biomolecular Interactions with AlphaFold 3.” Nature 614 (7949): 1–12. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-01425-0.\n\n———. 2024. “The Bioelectric Code: An Ancient Computational Medium for Dynamic Control of Growth and Form.” BioSystems 164: 76–93. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystems.2017.08.009.\n\nWang, Jinchang. 2023. “Self-Awareness, a Singularity of AI.” Philosophy Study 13 (2): 68–77. https://doi.org/10.17265/2159-5313/2023.02.003.\n\nWalsh, Toby. 2022. “The Meta-Turing Test.” arXiv:2205.05268.\nIs said that conventional Turing tests have a design flaw of asymmetry, and the Meta-Turing test (Walsh 2022) resolves this asymmetry by a peer grading approach where both entities, the tester, and the testee are accessed mutually through interaction, evaluating abilities to identify and critique flawed problem-solving approaches. This of course is useful in a conversational human-machine setting, but we could take the premise further to assess intelligence profiles across competency spaces.\nHere, we’d faced with obvious challenges of intelligibility between entities, and moreover levels on competency withing entity configuration.\nAlthough, if we keep the asymmetry, we overcome the intelligibility issue but we remain lacking the tools to correctly identify competencies in multi-scale embodiments, and temporal scales. From energy allocation “decisions” to dynamic reallocation of resources, outside a conversational scenario we re-think if we do have the means to assess how intelligent are the current AI systems actually are.\nThe meta-Turing test reintroduces the Chinese Room argument with a new perspective: “Could a system that explains its symbol manipulation processes (meta-cognition) cross the understanding threshold?”, and while the early experiments with large language models (LLMs) some degree of self-reflection capabilities was posit, these capabilities and the premise of the meta-Turinng test remain rooted in pattern recognition rather than experiential understanding, and rely on our ability to comprehend their explanations and identify underlying patterns.\nIt would be a considerable improvement to find a entity-agnostic method perhaps even to so focussed on testing but in identifying or translating competencies from the testee to the tester and vice versa.\nSo, how intelligent is the AI of today?\nWhile Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are often conflated, their meaning differs. AI is a broad concept, encompassing systems designed to solve problems or perform tasks and can use rule-based, or learning-based models in their components. Machine Learning (ML), by definition, expresses the engineered intent to learn by design. Not all Artificial Intelligence systems are designed to learn after training, thus Machine Learning could be seen as a subset of AI, aiming for systems that improve throughout exposure. Almost as if AI was the pursuit of creating “minds”, while ML is about creating “learning devices”.\nProposed by Joshua Bach in his 2007 thesis “Principles of Synthetic Intelligence PSI: An Architecture of Motivated Cognition” building on Dietrich Dörner’s Psi theory, it offers a comprehensive and philosophically grounded approach towards the creation of true intelligence, while at the same time attempting to understand it. Touching on enactive theories of agency(De Jesus 2018), where intelligence, autonomy, behaviour, purpose, and teleology(Rosenblueth, Wiener, and Bigelow 1943), suggests that embodiment, composition, and a variety of features would then allow for systemic preconditions for learning and perceiving, having goals, motivations, and the ability to navigate complex, uncertain environments.\n\nDe Jesus, P. 2018. “Thinking Through Enactive Agency: Sense-Making, Bio-Semiosis and the Ontologies of Organismic Worlds.” Phenomenology and Cognitive Sciences 17: 861–87. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11097-018-9562-2.\n\nRosenblueth, Arturo, Norbert Wiener, and Julian Bigelow. 1943. “Behavior, Purpose and Teleology.” Philosophy of Science 10 (1): 18–24. https://doi.org/10.1086/286788.\n\n———. 2021. “Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere: An Experimentally-Grounded Framework for Understanding Diverse Bodies and Minds.” Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience 15: 732372.\nWhen combining computational and biological views, a technological approach to mind everywhere, TAME (M. Levin 2021), gives us experimental evidence of a truly diverse spectrum of intelligent entities, and through which experimental means of interaction in spaces that are not our own.\nDrawing from evolutionary of biology, and the challenges faced by early life forms in surviving and adapting to their environments may actually be quite significant when aiming for truly adaptive AI (M. Levin, Pezzulo, and Finkelstein 2017) (Baluška and Levin 2016)\n\nLevin, M., G. Pezzulo, and J. M. Finkelstein. 2017. “Novosphingobium Sp. PP1Y as a Model for Studying Adaptive Decisions.” Frontiers in Microbiology 8: 2571.\n\nBaluška, F., and M. Levin. 2016. “On Having No Head: Cognition Throughout Biological Systems.” Frontiers in Psychology 7: 902.\n\nBach, J. 2009. Principles of Synthetic Intelligence PSI: An Architecture of Motivated Cognition. Oxford University Press.\n\nLevin, M. 2019. “The Computational Boundary of a \"Self\": Developmental Bioelectricity Drives Multicellularity and Scale-Free Cognition.” Frontiers in Psychology 10: 2688.\nMoreover, the views of embodied motivated cognition (Bach 2009), and the computational boundaries of a “self” (M. Levin 2019), also seem to suggest that architectures may vary, which challenges the static notions of intelligence as a property, into a process subject to interference, and where internal and external states interplay creating diminishing or augmented competency-state chains.\nAs such, and in a reduced form, “intelligence seems less connected to correct outputs in an abstract setting and more deeply intertwined interaction-based products of things and their environment.”\nSeeing intelligence as a process also allows for a substrate-independence view of what constitutes a mind, meaning that a mind could be the physical mapping of said process in a configuration space, instead of a brain or any embodied part. Associated with a mind are often mental representations and memories, and so is “self-reflection”, and it has been an accepted convention the the mind - body distinction. This notion is challenged (not to say outdated) when the memory of previously faced challenges persisted through complete brain regeneration of planarian flatworms (Shomrat and Levin 2013). As for the mapping of the process of intelligence in anatomical space, the above suggests that a mind would fit better a description of a network contributing to a form of body-wide information system(Michael Levin and Martyniuk 2018).\n\nShomrat, Tal, and Michael Levin. 2013. “An Automated Training Paradigm Reveals Long-Term Memory in Planarians and Its Persistence Through Head Regeneration.” The Journal of Experimental Biology 216 (20): 3799–3810. https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.087809.\n\nLevin, Michael, and Christopher J.
