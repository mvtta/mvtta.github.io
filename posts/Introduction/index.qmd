## **Open Notes**

Notes developed/explored, or direct entries that assumed a longer format. 
They have no revision in argumentation, nor a formal structure. 

If you wish to have a conversation with me, give me a review, 
here is my preferred method of contact is [email](mailto:mvtta@proton.me).   
Feel free to raise an issue on GitHub, and if you seek to co-create, submit a pull request.
