Before that, old clerics required new ones, creating literate minds to perpetuate the dogmatic pillars of societies.\nThese processes worked irrefutably then, and now, for a pair of decades, after two generations into the Industrial era, two wars eradicated the contextual roots that led to the newfound modernity, within the space-time continuum of existence.\nA beginning was forged, and the past obliviated.\nSo, what we have is the ‚Äòlife or death‚Äô decision to, no matter at what cost, participate in the system that produces a panoply of static socio-economic engines.\nGiven that formal education eradicates the why question from the equations, and there is a hungry mob of militants enforcing procedures and methods as doctrines, the addition of the life or death term, Educational institutions appear to be very effective at their crucial role in Humanity‚Äôs self-destruction.\nIt‚Äôs understandable if you disagree, but entertain the thought for a moment, what supports the argument won‚Äôt take long to pass across, and does the reader have anything to lose?\n\nArgument\nWe are information processing systems, not machines, but systems, of systems of several degrees of agency. There are fantastical and mesmerizing processes of intra-systemic communication, and collaboration that address all scales and allow us to breathe out of our conscious decision stage.\n‚ÄúAh, that is just physics‚Äù, say most institutions.\n\n\n\nAltText\n\n\nLevin, M. Bioelectric networks: the cognitive glue enabling evolutionary scaling from physiology to mind. Anim Cogn 26, 1865‚Äì1891 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-023-01780-3\nSo far, the argument is, that ‚ÄúEducation is essential for‚Äù\n\nsome future economic value\nsomehow better future societies\nx% increase amount of life-expectancy\n\nBy:\n\nRemoving doubt, the why question, from a very young age, ensuring the replication of social order and forging the tacit agreements on fundamental truths for the next generation to come\nTeaching complex systems to repeat the same static methods and externalizing processes, regardless of their dynamic nature\nPromising those who adhere with dedication, and precision to the set of static methodologies, a vague idea of prosperity, health and wealth\n\nOf course, the argument is not fully complete, but is important to juxtapose the information and lay the concurrent principles.\nIt is important to say at this point, that I do not argue that education is bad, nor am I defending illiteracy, child mortality and poverty. The argument defends Education at its root, the why of which education itself exists, sets the tone for further analysis on the meaning propelling this perversion, leading to the institutionalization of what once was considered a duty, and is now turning it into a privilege, for the privilege of being able to exercise it.\nTransferring the information gathered to new generations, to optimize the learning process across long periods, inter-generational learning one may call it, seems to be an evolutionary mechanism developed to prevent extinction, as most life forms on our planet contain. Most species do it in ways we haven‚Äôt been able to decode, as each system is limited by its perceptual range.\nRecapping, our education system:\nEducation is essential for:\n\nsome future economic value\nbetter future societies\nx% increase amount of life-expectancy\n\nBy:\n\nRemoving doubt, the why, from a very young age, ensuring social order and forging tacit agreements of fundamental truths\nTeaching complex systems to repeat the same methods and processes on the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the universe\nPromissing those who adhere with dedication and precision and hypothetical better future, based on static doctrines and inductive biases.\nBeing accessible exclusively for a discriminatory and deficient assessment of human potential\nUsed as an ordering power weapon\nObscuring and obstructing knowledge\nProprietary\n\nEvolution has its selection method, beyond Darwin‚Äôs linearity.

The goal of this note, and the ones that will follow, is to naively follow the threads and sprouts from the exploration itself. As part of these first attempts at independent research, the experimental nature of seeking first principles and training myself at refined thinking, proofing and argumentation, it is understandable that failure is a vertiginous eminence. I must remind myself that methodology without creativity is an arid field where nothing is found but drought and decay. Rain will only come if the intent is selfless, and the pursuit noble enough to transcend my flaws inspire collective wisdom, and contribute to all Life.\nAs a tooling system to approach the question at stake, I propose, while inviting whoever may see this open-research page to comment and contribute, the following: 1. Collect data 2. Sort data categorically 3. Experiement with visual abstraction using both Design and Lexicon approaches 3. 1 Examples will be sought across lexicon and academic domains 3. 2 Parallels will be tested visually in the time domain continuum 3. 3 Return to step 2. if necessary\n* Then plotting de abstractive objects in the time domain for sequential overview\nWhy is it useful to question something so robust as the current definitions and the distinction between Information Theories?\nAre there possibilities to further stretch it and find new fittings?\nIf the discovery of information is proven, how could it change our understanding of reality? Could misinformation become a crime? If we are not the true destination of information, what else is in the realm of Recipient/Observer, and qualifies as such? Even if nothing of value comes out of this, the model will not suffer when questioned, would only solidify its significance.\nIn my day to day I‚Äôm constantly reminded of Shannon‚Äôs Information Theory, and as starting point let‚Äôs take the axioms of the Mathematical Theory of Communication:"

    "text": "1938, Claude Shannon\n\nIntroducing the study of the fundamental limits in communication, applied to storage and transmission, for example, we refer to Claude Shannon where in 1938 he presents a beautiful, thoughtful, and elegant schematic for information as a process, drawing clear boundaries between steps.\nFrom an information source, a message X is transmitted via a medium, a signal is sent and then received, hopefully at the correct destination. Message X, to be transmitted, Claude thought that a binary encoding made sense, and the the bit as the smallest unit of information is born.\nInformation is treated with uncertainty and modeled as random variables. The transmitter and the receiver are made to send and receive either zero or one [0,1], ant the bits contain no reference to the meaning they represent.\nThe neighboring relationship and it‚Äôs predictive nature by association used frequently in data compression, poses an intriguing correlation with the degree of similarity between the spatio-temporal neural fluctuations of multiple people increasing by proximity. Aditionally, Neural Oscilations have also been correlated with information transfer spatially in the brain, perception and memory.\n/++++\nThinking about boundaries in the agents and communication, and even information as a process dates x and highlights y and z.\n/++++\nDNA is a sequence of amino acids, a long and monotonous of AGTC foldings, and its information is conveyed in the combination of the 4 symbols. In this case, can we define:\n\nThe source of information\nThe destination\nSize and properties of the set\n\n\nQuantity\n\nQuantifying\nIf the amount of information is tied to the probability of the event, is it logical to extrapolate that the amount of information is proportional to noise?\nThen, quantifying the amount of information in DNA by same principle, genetic mutations convey more information.\n\n\n\nContext\n\nKnown Context Dependency\nSpaces set etc meaning, reductions, categorization, assembly theory\n\n\n\nSource and Destination\n\nObserver Dependency\nIf there is no observer or destination, is Information still Information? How to qualify as an observer or a destination?\n\n\n\nPatterns\nRandomness, noise, extraordinary.\n\nEntropy == The amount of not Noise\nReconcile? The amount of information finds roots in the exceptions and disruptions to a pattern, not the pattern itself."

    "text": "The tone of this essay is emotional, untethered, free from any format constraint. It has no destination but the message itself.\nTo pursue knowledge is to honor the gift of life. From our mothers to our ancestors, all of them, we owe it, to the past, ad continuum.\nIn the year 2023, in the christian time-stamp, we live in a period where wonder decayed into pessimism. Some would argue that this pessimism is a fruit directly ripped from the knowledge we seek, ‚Äúperhaps we man are evil beings‚Äù, ‚Äúa virus we are‚Äù.\nI strongly disagree, we are not evil, but ignorant.\nWe may think that we have far past the dark ages of mysticism, but the enlightenment wasn‚Äôt any cure for this malady that affects this global civilization.\nIgnorance, and only that. To attribute morality to natural objects is a clear indication that we, as Humans, have not entertained the connection between ourselves and all the other life-scales.\nFor now, we still haven‚Äôt perceived that life is a continuum, on which we are its part and agency. Not only Nature has birthed us, but has incumbent on us the majestic responsibility to act on its behalf.\nWe surely are not doing justice in this delegation of agency, perhaps because man chooses to oblivion, and dismisses the underlying mechanism, the logic behind agency in natural processes.\nMen and their perception need to identify the breadcrumbs left by our Mother, we are not a single thread, detached, checked out, the fruit of random causation.\nThere seems to be no evidence supporting randomness in natural iterative design, only a scope of possibilities given a certain state of constraints, future agency by exploratory and combinatorial means.\nWhat if we were to rejoice in the wonder? To achieve constructivism, we must first admit defeat.\nIgnorance is a blank page on a notebook, where we can shape the immaterial manifestation of all the mothers and the fathers, the seeds of knowledge leading to observations, sense-making, discovery and emergence.\nLet us put down the distractions, reject conformity and think. What we came to name ‚Äúthe mind‚Äù is an evolutionary device that has been developing since the beginning of life-time.\nLife-time seems to be a continuum, the stage where life is assembled by building blocks driven by potential, where actors of molecular intelligence, memory at the smallest scale, and atomic units of agency, lead to larger systems at play in the interconnectedness of all there is.\nIn the scenario of the above proposed, it is understandable our ignorance, and condemnation is easy but not useful.\n[unfinished] Porto, Portugal, 05:30 am"

Lane‚Äôs works on seems to futher support the role of bio-eletricity in agency , basal awareness and metabolic transactions, and as he beautifully suggets , as a primary phenomena in the origin od life in protocells.\nPostulation on both premisses, and concatenating both frameworks, a continuum can look like this:\nUp untill this moment the separation and antagonization of different study and academic fields led to a global understanding that cannpot, by design, agree with one another,\nin this paper concepts will get on purpose intertwineed and adjoined, in an exploratory fashion, and attempts to recponcile natural organoization categories, not as static phenomena but as milestones in evolutionary porocessees, not random, but iterative, and then will tackle the glue or ajoining mechaninsm that allow milestone atchivement.\nHogher porder of complexity seems to deman abandonment, of sacrifice of the oroblematic over reductions or incomprehensability. This baflking experience seems to indicate a faalty background or a lack of perceptual capability from the obserber part. Yet, both lane and levin in their work, conceptualiozes as abstract framework that allows for highlevel thinkiong of the problematic of complexity. Moreover the concep or radical locality in agency and the emmergenc of extra-contextual propreties (buckminter) seem to fit this thematic and serve as an empirical design tool to visually mark oin the continuum.\n(‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. explain fig continuum 1.
