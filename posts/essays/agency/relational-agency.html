<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Abstract</h2>
<p>This article relates the first part of my inquiry on agency, in which I reviewed it from different lenses such as linguistic, political, and bio-chemical, with my most recent dwelling into necessary clarifications what I meant by “thing” and “relation”. Upon it, I revise my previous proposal where I pinned agency as a property of things, to something like the spatio-temporally distributed capacity allowing things and because of thing. Naturally, I’ll dissect those terms, identity, becoming and relating in a semi-formal attempt to express its recursive nature, setting the stage for the next step where I’ll try to simulate the generating mechanisms for and by these exchanges occurs.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level2" data-number="2">
<h2 data-number="2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Introduction:</h2>
<p>The polysemic nature of “agency” across scientific disciplines reflects not conceptual confusion but proximity to an organisational principle operating across all scales of spatiotemporal structure/events. When addressing matters concerning agency, unavoidable efforts toward formal and operable understanding of identity, boundaries, selves and their quantities. This of course from the perceptual evidence we’ve gathers that things in the universe seem to relate, allowed by design, or now engineered for such, adding to the multiplicity of agents, in the agent discussion, from chemical catalysts to institutions. Previously I asserted, for this same reason, that we could simplify from “agents to things” as it would serve this study enormously well. I’ve repeated this, but clarity in abstraction is more than an exercise in discipline, as it seems a form of symbolic compression, simplifying but not reducing, Through systematic integration of experimental evidence from protein turnover in organic systems, bioelectric morphogenesis, at stake is a possible demonstration that agency is a linguistic pointer to an overall capacity to affect and be affected, a relational dynamic that operates through processual identity, boundary, mediated interactions, and across scales, where things are vehicles for both, principals and agents intrinsically.</p>
<p>Why? Stated and widely accepted is agency as a capacity or property that agents possess, creating immediate problems: what makes something an agent? Why some have rights and responsibilities, leverage, and others considered as such without the benefit of consideration? The answer typically involves circular reasoning; agents are things that have agency, and agency is what agents have, or agency in context X assumed only agents of context X. This circularity and fragmentation dissolves if we pose agency as a relational distributed capacity; put simply agency as the way and measure of things affect and be affected by what’s not the same.</p>
<p>Opening this inquiry lane revealed agents everywhere. Driving change, changing, composing, being composed, belonging, allowing for and becoming of. Chemicals, proteins, cells, organisms, institutions, markets. The ubiquity of agency across scales, from molecular to institutional, both in language, code, as signs and signals, as energy exchanges; echoing not a special property that came from the human construct and we impose on the world but as something we as a species seem to have a degree of competency in recognising. As pattern, and through our fragmented practices in disciplinary discourse and context dependant sense-making ability, we have been spotting across our endeavors and documenting it, sometimes more concretely than others (embedding graph of polysemic analysis via unsupervised labeling). The polysemic nature of “agency” across disciplines, besides presenting what appears to be an intractable conceptual challenge, yet may point toward deeper relational substrate that permeates multiple levels of organisation. The fragmentation mentioned above can also point to the broader epistemic crisis described by Foucault’s analysis of post, industrial knowledge siloing where biology studies “cells” as static units, economics reifies “markets” as virtual systems, and physics treats “particles” as isolated substances.</p>
<p>If we entertain the assumption that things in the universe relate to some degree, which we have we have no evidence otherwise; then defining things and what makes them distinct means of, allowing said degrees of relation, requires addressing identity, boundary and relations in spatial and temporal dimensions. This exercise seems to have major benefits: if only a subset of things in the universe related, by opposition of a general property of the universe, then learning why and how would be rather informative about the nature of the medium in which we exist. In either scenario, the implications of things relating comprise that agency, or this relating capacity, should be in theory measurable regardless of its nature, though not necessarily constant; and it should be scale-appropriate, concerning the space of things.</p>

<section id="effect-and-affect" class="level2" data-number="3">
<h2 data-number="3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="effect-and-affect"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Effect and Affect</h2>
<p>Agency as the capacity to affect and be affected. This definition, rooted in Spinoza’s view, avoids the circular reasoning of agent, based approaches. A thing’s agency is not an intrinsic property but a relational capacity that depends on what it’s made of, what’s connected to, it’s intrinsic and extrinsic morphology, the permeability of its boundaries, and its context.</p>
<p>If we consider protein folding, a protein’s “agency”, its capacity to catalyze reactions, bind to other molecules, or change conformation, depends on its three, dimensional structure (morphology), its hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions (boundaries), and the chemical environment (extrinsic relational context). The protein affects other molecules and is affected by them. Its agency is not a property it possesses but a dynamic pattern of affecting and being affected.</p>
<p>Along this study, previously proposed agential ideas (todo: put link to final manuscript), posed agency as a property of things, allowing for and receptive of varied forms of action (from physics). We identified energy transaction as a phenomena connecting things though scales, and I left in the air an intuition of networks of causation, drawing the medium of unfolding. However, numerous gaps remained elusive and reaching a definition for what many disciplines point to as agency required addressing the nature of being.</p>
<p>I’ll go where it takes me, however daunting, and it has brought us here, facing a potentially relational view, begging an explanations of why energy powered transactions mediators appear at every scale, transforming, encoding, and at each level of organization, things have specific ways to affect and be affected by other things.</p>
</section>
<section id="morphology-and-agential-potential" class="level2" data-number="4">
<h2 data-number="4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="morphology-and-agential-potential"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Morphology and Agential Potential</h2>
<p>Morphology, the form, structure, or pattern of a thing, constrains and enables this capacity, agency. A protein’s three, dimensional structure determines what it can bind to and what reactions it can catalyze. A cell’s membrane architecture determines what can enter and exit. An institution’s organizational structure and means, determines how it can exercise power and influence.</p>
<p>Morphology creates what we term <strong>agential potential</strong>: the space of possible affects a thing can have or receive. This potential includes both positive and negative capacities; the ability to enhance or diminish, to attract or repel, to facilitate or inhibit. Agential potential is not static but changes as morphology changes and by coupling interaction with the environment.</p>
<p>The concept of agential potential parallels potential energy in physics but extends beyond mechanical systems to encompass all forms of affecting and being affected. Just as potential energy represents the capacity for change based on position or configuration, agential potential represents the capacity for relational change based on morphological configuration.</p>
<p>We relate to energy transfers and trajectories, with action and potential in physics, but we halted our study because we were using things and objects instead of systems. As I dislike systems language in general, I required a deeper understanding on these terms to explain or understand if by ranks, nesting and interconnection of said morphologies. How does anything come to be?</p>

<h2 data-number="5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="identity-as-a-process-exiting-as-a-temporal-pattern"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Identity As a Process, Exiting As a Temporal Pattern</h2>
<p>The new efforts in this project pose identity, not as a fixed essence but a processual leading to pattern that appears to us as persisting through space and time, addressing the question of <em>“how can something remain the same while changing?”</em></p>
<p>The traditional substance approach treats identity as self, a thing is what it is by virtue of possessing certain intrinsic properties. This tautological statement does not explain how a thing can maintain identity while undergoing constant molecular turnover, developmental transformation, or environmental adaptation. It does not explain how thing can be, belong and compose. Aiming to address identity meaningfully, I first reviews the surprising and extensive body of work on “thingness” which revealed insightful notions helping the proposal and formalism for a “self” not merely as the limit <span class="math inline">\(\text{Id}(X) = \lim_{\to \text{interactions}} X_t\)</span> but as a <strong>structured cospan</strong> reconciling intrinsic and extrinsic phase-states:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[X_t \xrightarrow{\alpha} I \xleftarrow{\beta} E_{t+1}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(X_t\)</span> is the system at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> encodes intrinsic organizational states, and <span class="math inline">\(E_{t+1}\)</span> is the extrinsic phase-state that constitutes what is other than <span class="math inline">\(t+1\)</span>. Identity persists if there exists a retract <span class="math inline">\(r: E_{t+1} \to I\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(r \circ \beta = \mathrm{id}_I\)</span>, anchoring the thing in spatiotemporal dimensions.</p>
<p>Human cells replace their entire protein content every 7-10 days, yet maintain recognizable identity. This seems possible because identity is not material composition only buta allow by it, as pattern of molecular turnover rates. Proteins within the same functional complex coordinate their degradation and synthesis, maintaining relational patterns even as individual molecules are replaced. This is why we formalise cellular identity <span class="math inline">\(I(t)\)</span> as the time-varying coherence of an assembly whose parts are continually replaced:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I(t) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=1}^{N}\exp[-k_{\text{deg},k} \cdot t]\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(k_{\text{deg},k}\)</span> is the degradation constant for protein <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. Identity is the integral of these coordinated turnover processes, a temporal pattern of affecting and being affected that persists through material change, but not exclusively. The membrane of a cell is what makes it a cell, no membrane and the identity of such and the affordance of being dissolves into the environment. Yet in the case of a cell is alegoric, and literal while for a cloud of a forest, the boundary-identity construction, and the premise of it being an interface operating for internal and external relations, challenges strict delineations.</p>
</section>
<section id="boundaries-as-relational-interfaces" class="level2" data-number="6">
<h2 data-number="6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="boundaries-as-relational-interfaces"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Boundaries as Relational Interfaces</h2>
<p>A forest maintains its identity not through the persistence of individual trees but through patterns of growth, death, and regeneration, networks of roots, and other things that compose and belong the the bio-region. An institution maintains its identity not through the persistence of individual members but through patterns of role occupancy, rule enforcement, and resource allocation.</p>
<p>Boundaries are not barriers but relational interfaces that mediate how things affect each other. They are neither inside nor outside but the dynamic interface through which affecting occurs.</p>
<p>Boundaries (<span class="math inline">\(B_S\)</span>) are thus not passive containers but phase-state mediators, filtering and conditioning relations (<span class="math inline">\(R_S\)</span>); fuzzy and context-related. Identity and boundary are fundamentally co-constitutive: identity is a contextually coherent, transient state that develops from the dynamic interplay between a system’s intrinsic states, and extrinsic events, realised through structured cospans and stabilized via retraction conditions. Boundaries are not static lines or mere containers, but active, context-dependent phase-state mediators that filter, enable, and reshape the very identity allowing interactions that constitute identity.</p>
<p>In planarian regeneration, bioelectric patterns establish morphological boundaries within hours of injury. These boundaries are not pre-existing structures but dynamic patterns of membrane potential that determine head-tail polarity. The boundary is constituted by the differential capacity of cells to affect each other through gap junction communication.</p>
<p>We previously defined boundary dynamics modeled as (todo: data for the example, levin):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[B(t) = \sigma(\Delta V_{\text{mem}}(t))\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> represents the sigmoidal conductance of gap junction networks. Quantitative measurements demonstrate that anterior blastemas maintain depolarized membrane voltage (-25 to -35 mV) relative to posterior blastemas (-40 to -50 mV) throughout the first 48 hours of regeneration.</p>
<p>Experimental manipulation seems to provides critical validation for the hypothesis, where external and unforeseen intervention depolarises tissue during the first 3 hours of regeneration which completely alters morphogenetic outcomes, producing double-headed phenotypes despite washout of depolarising agents. This proves that boundaries function as <strong>enabling constraints</strong> that actively shape relational possibilities rather than merely containing things.</p>

<h2 data-number="7" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="relation-allowing-for-scaling-patterns"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Relation Allowing For Scaling Patterns</h2>
<p>Relations are not connections between pre-existing things but patterns of affectation that operate across scales. Some patterns have been documented as making appearances into observations as scale-invariant, which I think may be relevant to explain the nature of thing arrange themselves in meaningful ways. The relational work’s core thesis, that relations are ontological substrate rather than secondary properties, finding some empirical tractability. An out of the box experiment, is the communication activity which follows Gibrat’s law scaling with exponent <span class="math inline">\(\beta \approx 0.2\)</span>, derived from long-term correlation patterns spanning over one year. Here the scale-invariance is species dependant, yet if we entertain it, the relational event <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> across populations through long-range correlated growth processes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sigma_{r|m_0} = C \cdot m_0^{-\beta}, \quad 0 &lt; \beta &lt; \frac{1}{2}\]</span></p>
<p>where the Hurst exponent connects through <span class="math inline">\(H = 1 - \beta\)</span>, quantifying relational persistence across temporal scales. Measured values <span class="math inline">\(H \approx 0.78-0.88\)</span> indicate that individual communications remain correlated across temporal scales from days to years.</p>
<p>This scaling reveals that relations are scale-spanning patterns. A conversation between two people participates in patterns that extend across days, months, and years. The scaling exponent quantifies how local interactions nest within broader temporal patterns.</p>
<p>Rather than entities entering into relationships, <strong>persistent relational patterns</strong> enable the recognizable entities (communication roles, social identities). The mathematical framework relating growth fluctuations to correlation patterns suggests universal mechanisms underlying scaling laws across economic, biological, and social systems.</p>

<p>Agency operates through nested patterns of affecting across multiple scales. Molecular affects enable cellular affects, which enable tissue affects, which enable organismal affects. Each scale has its own characteristic morphologies, boundaries, and temporal rhythms, but these scales are not independent; they are nested patterns of affecting.</p>
<p>Considering the temporal dimensions, if each process exhibits <strong>temporal side of agency</strong>, the capacity to maintain coherent organization across time through selective interaction with its medium-phase-space.</p>
<p><strong>Nested processes</strong> where faster dynamics enable slower dynamics while slower dynamics constrain faster dynamics. Protein turnover rates within regenerating planarian tissues are actively modulated by bioelectric fields that coordinate morphogenetic outcomes. Planarian regenerative capacity reflects evolutionary processes that have shaped developmental genetic networks over geological timescales, creating <strong>temporal nesting</strong> where each organizational level both constrains and enables other levels.</p>
<p>The nesting is not hierarchical but recursive. Higher-scale patterns constrain lower-scale affects, while lower-scale affects enable higher-scale patterns. This recursive causation creates <strong>scalar coupling</strong>: the coordination of affecting across scales through boundary-mediated interactions. The question of course is why?</p>

<h2 data-number="9" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="power-laws-and-relational-persistence"><span class="header-section-number">9</span> Power Laws and Relational Persistence</h2>
<p>Power laws in biological and social systems reveal how relational patterns persist across scales. The consistent observation of <strong>power-law scaling relationships</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(\beta \approx 0.2 \pm 0.1\)</span>) across biological, communication, and economic systems provides empirical evidence for <strong>universal energy constraints</strong> on relational organization. These scaling laws reflect how <strong>energy must be distributed</strong> to maintain coherent patterns across nested spatiotemporal scales.</p>
<p><strong>Membrane voltage measurements</strong> demonstrate that bioelectric agency requires continuous <strong>energy expenditure</strong> through ion pumps and channels to maintain voltage gradients. Typical membrane potentials (-40 to -80 mV) represent stored energy that enables selective relational coupling; the <strong>energetic foundation</strong> of agency as spatiotemporal influence capacity.</p>
<p>These power laws are not statistical curiosities but signatures of how affecting operates across scales. They reveal that agency is not localized to particular scales but distributed across nested patterns of affecting that span multiple temporal and spatial scales.</p>

<h2 data-number="10" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="relational-agency"><span class="header-section-number">10</span> Relational Agency</h2>
<p>The very basic idea is that agent is an acting influence. Naturally, we may vew this process producing an action, effectuating a trajectory into the future and affecting the surroundings and the agent itself. This is quite familiar with a general undertanding of what a relation is. Relation symbols in mathematics are a frame of reference of something with something else, in a relational two or more things are required, then we have different and rather specific ways of relating things, arranging things into meaning, or making-sense of things. If created by resemblance or convention, a relation that something has to itself, to be meaningful, the selves had to change in any given way such as the first selve and the second to be mapped by this relation. What strikes me as outrageous here is that this is so obvious in its resembles with recursion and generative process that surely someone else has to have had formalise this insight.</p>
<p>If entities exist because relational patterns, which generate other relational patterns, given its agential potential, what is agency, and was there a beginning, a generative singularity?</p>
<p>Traditional metaphysics treats relations as secondary to relata; things first exist independently and then enter into relationships with other things. A relational ontology for the universe reverses this priority, and relations become ontologically more fundamental than the entities themselves.</p>
<p>But what if both the substance and the relation were one pattern, what would the geometry of a medium producing these patterns?</p>
<p>A doodle to later inform myself of the idea goes as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Reality} = \Sigma\partial(\text{interactions})\]</span></p>
<p>where boundaries (∂) emerge from interactions rather than preceding them. This formulation suggests that what we experience reality as the collection of “things” as stable patterns in the field of relation; temporary stabilities in ongoing but patterned change.</p>

<h2 data-number="11" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-nature-of-becoming"><span class="header-section-number">11</span> The Nature of Becoming</h2>
<p>The processual understanding of identity and boundaries converges onto an understanding of what we might call the nature of <strong>becoming</strong>. Becoming is not change happening to static things but the fundamental character of things themselves. Things do not become; things ARE becoming; other things?</p>
<p>Since Parmenides and Heraclitus, the tension between being and becoming has reigned debates, I wonder if we have to decide at all. Being-as-becoming implies a understanding, explaining and predicting the the patterning of a phase-state, or the achievement, within frames of temporary coherence that happen through ongoing relational engagement.</p>
<p>What are the means for such events in what we call the universe, why does this seem to prevail amidst all change, intentional, causal, random, arbitrary, deliberate and senseless?</p>
<p>Is agency coining the act of harnessing it, or is that within the agential potential of thing to achieve or not?</p>
<p>Grappling with the forces that drive change, we venture onto these depths not by intellectual vanity but as a response to empirical discoveries across multiple inquiry domains, and by the necessity and usefulness of answering this question, which could make of senseless things into something else. This transition yields to what Alfred North Whitehead termed a philosophy of organism, where reality is constituted by processes “all the way down” rather than by static substances that happen to interact. Almost as if materialism could be challenged not by discourse alone but by logic. Instead of treating processes as modifications that happen to things, for a reason that is unknown to us, equating that things may be “transient patterns” which at scale produce a coherent effect, a stability, seems to be better aligned with evidence than the other way around. The very fact that we can bundle material together implies the necessity of a deeper explanation, if material, some of it agential, could not relate, would it be agential at all, or all material that relates is agential?</p>

<h2 data-number="12" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-co-constitution-of-agency-identity-boundaries-and-relations"><span class="header-section-number">12</span> The Co-Constitution of Agency, Identity, Boundaries, and Relations</h2>
<p>I once had a dream, I saw a system, with a structural foundations similar to bones tinted with a cold blue hue. along the system a glowing region changed cyclically, givin the impression of a traveling node. As it journied through the system, certain parts of it seem to be reeinforced somehow by the number of times this glowing node visited. Along the path, these checkpoints were distributed and visited and revised, and in my dream I remember thinking “Oh, interesting, this is a transcription process, and an embedded safe-guard agaist information loss, perhaps this is how memories are made and encoded”. Agency, identity, boundaries, and relations are co-constitutive aspects of the same dynamic process, where agency allows becoming and being, then identity, boundaries, and relations are a provider of phase-state coherence through which things affect each other, ultimately generating other things. I became hung up on this generative effect, by affectation. Why and how would a medium allow for it? Identity constrains agency by providing processual patterns that persist through affecting. Boundaries mediate agency by providing interfaces through which affecting occurs. Relations coordinate agency by providing scale-spanning patterns that nest affects, and consequences… are the causal networks we can’t yet draw part of the very medium allowing relations?</p>
<p>A relational ontology does not seem to suffice, we may be trying to graps something with processual, energetic, and relational properties, where via and because of phase-state mediators, coherence enables more coherence. We’re tracking with notions that tie not only past states to future ones, but also notions of unfolding, discussions that surround Aristotelian efficient causation and the Daoist shi (勢) as the propensity of situations to unfold, we relate causation and unfolding as describing something that has been said to weave spatiotemporal states.</p>
<p>This co-constitution recurrent happenings, may be at the core of why there seems to be a cause and an effect in the first place. Putting cause-and-effect as an ontological precedent to material, actually seems to include something that allows the becoming or even becomes because of this transfer between past and future. Almost as if whatever travels between and because of phase-states is the very source of reality. Perceiving these events at the scales available to us, may be what has led us to signal “agency” and “agents” in such varied contexts and diverse manifestations. It is not that everything “has” agency as a property, but that everything exists through patterns of affecting and being affected. Agency seems more likely to be a sign of something more fundamental, a dynamic through which everyhting was, is, and will be.</p>
