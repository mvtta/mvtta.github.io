<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Abstract</h2>
<p>The polysemic nature of “agency” across scientific disciplines reflects not conceptual confusion but proximity to a fundamental organizational principle operating across all scales of spatiotemporal structure. When addressing matters concerning agency, unavoidable efforts arise toward formal and operable understanding of the concepts, quantities, and those assumed to have it. Given the multiplicity of agents—from chemical catalysts to institutions—a proper generalization from “agents to things” serves this study enormously well. Through systematic integration of experimental evidence from protein turnover dynamics, bioelectric morphogenesis, and communication scaling laws, we demonstrate that agency is the capacity to affect and be affected—a relational dynamic that operates through processual identity, boundary-mediated interactions, and scale-spanning relational patterns. This article establishes empirical foundations for understanding how things persist, transform, and relate across nested scales, revealing agency as the universe’s fundamental mechanism for navigating the tension between coherent self-organization and transformative relational exchange.</p>

<section id="introduction-from-agents-to-relational-dynamics" class="level2" data-number="2">
<h2 data-number="2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-from-agents-to-relational-dynamics"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Introduction: From Agents to Relational Dynamics</h2>
<p>Agents are everywhere. Chemical catalysts accelerate reactions. Proteins fold and unfold. Cells migrate and divide. Organisms hunt and mate. Institutions regulate and distribute. Markets fluctuate and crash. The ubiquity of agency across scales—from molecular to institutional—suggests that agency is not a special property possessed by certain entities, but a fundamental dynamic of how things affect each other.</p>
<p>If we entertain the assumption that all things in the universe relate to some degree—we have no evidence otherwise—then defining things and what makes them distinct, allowing said degrees of relation, requires addressing both spatial and temporal dimensions. This exercise has major benefits: if only a subset of things related, learning why and how would be informative about the nature of the medium in which we exist. In either scenario, the implications of things relating comprise that agency should be measurable regardless of their nature, though not necessarily constant—it should relate to the scale-space of things.</p>
<p>The polysemic nature of “agency” across disciplines—from political theory to quantum biology, from planarian regeneration to cosmic web formation—presents what appears to be an intractable conceptual challenge, yet may point toward deeper relational substrate that permeates multiple levels of organization. This linguistic multiplicity mirrors the broader epistemic crisis described by Foucault’s analysis of post-industrial knowledge fragmentation where biology studies “cells” as static units, economics reifies “markets” as virtual systems, and physics treats “particles” as isolated substances.</p>
<p>Traditional approaches treat agency as a capacity or property that agents possess, creating immediate problems: what makes something an agent? The answer typically involves circular reasoning—agents are things that have agency, and agency is what agents have. This circularity dissolves when we recognize that agency is not a property but a relational dynamic: the way things affect and are affected by other things.</p>
</section>
<section id="agency-as-affective-capacity" class="level2" data-number="3">
<h2 data-number="3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="agency-as-affective-capacity"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Agency as Affective Capacity</h2>
<p>Agency is the capacity to affect and be affected. This definition, rooted in Spinoza’s ethics, avoids the circular reasoning of agent-based approaches. A thing’s agency is not an intrinsic property but a relational capacity that depends on its morphology, its boundaries, and its relational context.</p>
<p>Consider protein folding. A protein’s “agency”—its capacity to catalyze reactions, bind to other molecules, or change conformation—depends on its three-dimensional structure (morphology), its hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions (boundaries), and the chemical environment (relational context). The protein affects other molecules and is affected by them. Its agency is not a property it possesses but a dynamic pattern of affecting and being affected.</p>
<p>Previously we managed to propose some agential ideas, posing agency as a property of things, allowing for and receptive of varied forms of action. We identified energy transaction as a phenomena connecting things towards complexity. However, numerous gaps remained elusive and reaching a definition for what many disciplines point to as agency required addressing the nature of being.</p>
<p>This relational view explains why agents appear at every scale. At each level of organization, things have specific capacities to affect and be affected by other things. These capacities are constrained by morphology and enabled by boundaries that mediate relations with the environment.</p>
</section>
<section id="morphology-and-agential-potential" class="level2" data-number="4">
<h2 data-number="4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="morphology-and-agential-potential"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Morphology and Agential Potential</h2>
<p>Morphology—the form, structure, or pattern of a thing—constrains and enables agency. A protein’s three-dimensional structure determines what it can bind to and what reactions it can catalyze. A cell’s membrane architecture determines what can enter and exit. An institution’s organizational structure determines how it can exercise power and influence.</p>
<p>Morphology creates what we term <strong>agential potential</strong>: the space of possible affects a thing can have or receive. This potential includes both positive and negative capacities—the ability to enhance or diminish, to attract or repel, to facilitate or inhibit. Agential potential is not static but changes as morphology changes through interaction with the environment.</p>
<p>The concept of agential potential parallels potential energy in physics but extends beyond mechanical systems to encompass all forms of affecting and being affected. Just as potential energy represents the capacity for change based on position or configuration, agential potential represents the capacity for relational change based on morphological configuration.</p>
<p>We relate to energy transfers and trajectories, with action and potential in physics, but we halted our study because we were using things and objects instead of systems. As I dislike systems language in general, I required proper terms to explain or understand the ranks, nestedness and interconnection of said morphologies. How does anything come to be.</p>

<section id="identity-as-processual-pattern" class="level2" data-number="5">
<h2 data-number="5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="identity-as-processual-pattern"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Identity as Processual Pattern</h2>
<p>Identity is not a fixed essence but a processual pattern of affecting and being affected that persists through time. This processual view resolves the classical problem of persistence: how can something remain the same while changing?</p>
<p>The traditional substance approach treats identity as self-evident—a thing is what it is by virtue of possessing certain intrinsic properties or essences. This tautological statement does not explain how a thing can maintain identity while undergoing constant molecular turnover, developmental transformation, or environmental adaptation. If we aim to address identity meaningfully, we must address coherence and persistence in spatiotemporal dimensions.</p>
<p>There was extensive work on “thingness” that revealed insightful notions helping propose formalism for a “self” not merely as the limit <span class="math inline">\(\text{Id}(X) = \lim_{\to \text{interactions}} X_t\)</span> but as a <strong>structured cospan</strong> reconciling intrinsic and extrinsic phase-states:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[X_t \xrightarrow{\alpha} I \xleftarrow{\beta} E_{t+1}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(X_t\)</span> is the system at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> encodes intrinsic organizational states, and <span class="math inline">\(E_{t+1}\)</span> is the extrinsic phase-state that constitutes what is other than <span class="math inline">\(t+1\)</span>. Identity persists if there exists a retract <span class="math inline">\(r: E_{t+1} \to I\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(r \circ \beta = \mathrm{id}_I\)</span>, anchoring the thing in spatiotemporal dimensions.</p>
<p>Human cells replace their entire protein content every 7-10 days, yet maintain recognizable identity. This is possible because identity is not material composition but a pattern of molecular turnover rates. Proteins within the same functional complex coordinate their degradation and synthesis, maintaining relational patterns even as individual molecules are replaced.</p>
<p>We formalize cellular identity <span class="math inline">\(I(t)\)</span> as the time-varying coherence of an assembly whose parts are continually replaced:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I(t) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=1}^{N}\exp[-k_{\text{deg},k} \cdot t]\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(k_{\text{deg},k}\)</span> is the degradation constant for protein <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. Identity is the integral of these coordinated turnover processes—a temporal pattern of affecting and being affected that persists through material change.</p>
<p>This processual view of identity applies across scales. A forest maintains its identity not through the persistence of individual trees but through patterns of growth, death, and regeneration. An institution maintains its identity not through the persistence of individual members but through patterns of role occupancy, rule enforcement, and resource allocation.</p>
</section>
<section id="boundaries-as-relational-interfaces" class="level2" data-number="6">
<h2 data-number="6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="boundaries-as-relational-interfaces"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Boundaries as Relational Interfaces</h2>
<p>Boundaries are not barriers but relational interfaces that mediate how things affect each other. They are neither inside nor outside but the dynamic interface through which affecting occurs.</p>
<p>Boundaries (<span class="math inline">\(B_S\)</span>) are thus not passive containers but phase-state mediators, filtering and conditioning relations (<span class="math inline">\(R_S\)</span>)—fuzzy and context-related. Identity and boundary are fundamentally co-constitutive: identity is a contextually coherent, transient state that develops from the dynamic interplay between a system’s intrinsic invariants and its extrinsic interactions, realized through structured cospans and stabilized via retraction conditions. Boundaries are not static lines or mere containers, but active, context-dependent phase-state mediators that filter, enable, and reshape the very interactions that constitute identity.</p>
<p>In planarian regeneration, bioelectric patterns establish morphological boundaries within hours of injury. These boundaries are not pre-existing structures but dynamic patterns of membrane potential that determine head-tail polarity. The boundary is constituted by the differential capacity of cells to affect each other through gap junction communication.</p>
<p>Boundary dynamics can be modeled as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[B(t) = \sigma(\Delta V_{\text{mem}}(t))\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> represents the sigmoidal conductance of gap junction networks. Quantitative measurements demonstrate that anterior blastemas maintain depolarized membrane voltage (-25 to -35 mV) relative to posterior blastemas (-40 to -50 mV) throughout the first 48 hours of regeneration.</p>
<p>Experimental manipulation provides critical validation: artificially depolarizing tissue during the first 3 hours of regeneration completely alters morphogenetic outcomes, producing double-headed phenotypes despite washout of depolarizing agents. This proves that boundaries function as <strong>enabling constraints</strong> that actively shape relational possibilities rather than merely containing them.</p>
</section>
<section id="relations-as-scaling-patterns" class="level2" data-number="7">
<h2 data-number="7" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="relations-as-scaling-patterns"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Relations as Scaling Patterns</h2>
<p>Relations are not connections between pre-existing things but patterns of affecting that operate across scales. These patterns exhibit characteristic scaling laws that reveal the deep structure of relational organization.</p>
<p>This challenge finds empirical resolution in communication scaling laws research. The relational work’s core thesis—that relations are ontological substrate rather than secondary properties—finds empirical validation in human communication scaling laws. Communication activity follows Gibrat’s law scaling with exponent <span class="math inline">\(\beta \approx 0.2\)</span>, derived from long-term correlation patterns spanning over one year.</p>
<p>We formalize relational flux <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> across populations through long-range correlated growth processes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sigma_{r|m_0} = C \cdot m_0^{-\beta}, \quad 0 &lt; \beta &lt; \frac{1}{2}\]</span></p>
<p>where the Hurst exponent connects through <span class="math inline">\(H = 1 - \beta\)</span>, quantifying relational persistence across temporal scales. Measured values <span class="math inline">\(H \approx 0.78-0.88\)</span> indicate that individual communications remain correlated across temporal scales from days to years.</p>
<p>This scaling reveals that relations are not local interactions but scale-spanning patterns. A conversation between two people participates in patterns that extend across days, months, and years. The scaling exponent quantifies how local interactions nest within broader temporal patterns.</p>
<p>Rather than entities entering into relationships, <strong>persistent relational patterns</strong> enable the recognizable entities (communication roles, social identities). The mathematical framework relating growth fluctuations to correlation patterns suggests universal mechanisms underlying scaling laws across economic, biological, and social systems.</p>

<section id="nested-affecting-across-scales" class="level2" data-number="8">
<h2 data-number="8" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nested-affecting-across-scales"><span class="header-section-number">8</span> Nested Affecting Across Scales</h2>
<p>Agency operates through nested patterns of affecting across multiple scales. Molecular affects enable cellular affects, which enable tissue affects, which enable organismal affects. Each scale has its own characteristic morphologies, boundaries, and temporal rhythms, but these scales are not independent—they are nested patterns of affecting.</p>
<p>Considering the temporal dimensions, a complex protein maintains its functional identity through coordinated synthesis and degradation cycles that unfold over hours to days. A planarian regenerates its morphological identity through bioelectric and genetic cascades that unfold over days to weeks. A forest ecosystem maintains its ecological identity through succession cycles that unfold over decades to centuries. Each process exhibits <strong>temporal agency</strong>—the capacity to maintain coherent organization across time through selective interaction with its medium-phase-space.</p>
<p>Empirical evidence reveals <strong>nested processes</strong> where faster dynamics enable slower dynamics while slower dynamics constrain faster dynamics. Protein turnover rates within regenerating planarian tissues are actively modulated by bioelectric fields that coordinate morphogenetic outcomes. Planarian regenerative capacity reflects evolutionary processes that have shaped developmental genetic networks over geological timescales, creating <strong>temporal nesting</strong> where each organizational level both constrains and enables other levels.</p>
<p>The nesting is not hierarchical but recursive. Higher-scale patterns constrain lower-scale affects, while lower-scale affects enable higher-scale patterns. This recursive causation creates <strong>scalar coupling</strong>: the coordination of affecting across scales through boundary-mediated interactions.</p>

<h2 data-number="9" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="power-laws-and-relational-persistence"><span class="header-section-number">9</span> Power Laws and Relational Persistence</h2>
<p>Power laws in biological and social systems reveal how relational patterns persist across scales. The consistent observation of <strong>power-law scaling relationships</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(\beta \approx 0.2 \pm 0.1\)</span>) across biological, communication, and economic systems provides empirical evidence for <strong>universal energy constraints</strong> on relational organization. These scaling laws reflect how <strong>energy must be distributed</strong> to maintain coherent patterns across nested spatiotemporal scales.</p>
<p><strong>Membrane voltage measurements</strong> demonstrate that bioelectric agency requires continuous <strong>energy expenditure</strong> through ion pumps and channels to maintain voltage gradients. Typical membrane potentials (-40 to -80 mV) represent stored energy that enables selective relational coupling—the <strong>energetic foundation</strong> of agency as spatiotemporal influence capacity.</p>
<p>These power laws are not statistical curiosities but signatures of how affecting operates across scales. They reveal that agency is not localized to particular scales but distributed across nested patterns of affecting that span multiple temporal and spatial scales.</p>

<h2 data-number="10" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-relational-inversion"><span class="header-section-number">10</span> The Relational Inversion</h2>
<p>The convergence of processual identity, boundary dynamics, and relational substrate leads to a radical conclusion: relations are not properties that entities happen to possess but the ontological substrate from which entities exist. This represents the <strong>relational inversion</strong>—the recognition that entities exist because relational patterns persist, rather than relating because entities happen to exist.</p>
<p>Traditional metaphysics treats relations as secondary to relata—things first exist independently and then enter into relationships with other things. Relational ontology reverses this priority, recognizing relations as ontologically more fundamental than the entities themselves. This inversion is not merely conceptual but reflects empirical discoveries across multiple domains.</p>
<p>The formal expression of this relational substrate might be represented as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Reality} = \Sigma\partial(\text{interactions})\]</span></p>
<p>where boundaries (∂) emerge from interactions rather than preceding them. This formulation suggests that what we experience as “things” are stable patterns in the field of relation—temporary stabilities in ongoing relational flows.</p>

<h2 data-number="11" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-nature-of-becoming"><span class="header-section-number">11</span> The Nature of Becoming</h2>
<p>The processual understanding of identity and boundaries converges on a unified understanding of what we might call the nature of <strong>becoming</strong>. Becoming is not change happening to static things but the fundamental character of things themselves. Things do not become; things ARE becoming—temporary stabilities in the ongoing flow of relational processes.</p>
<p>This understanding resolves the classical tension between being and becoming that has structured Western metaphysics since Parmenides and Heraclitus. Rather than choosing between unchanging being and ceaseless flux, processual ontology recognizes being-as-becoming—the achievement of temporary coherence through ongoing relational engagement.</p>
<p>Grappling with the forces that drive change, we venture onto these depths not by intellectual vanity but as a response to empirical discoveries across multiple inquiry domains. This transition demands what Alfred North Whitehead termed a philosophy of organism, where reality is constituted by processes “all the way down” rather than by static substances that happen to interact. Instead of treating processes as modifications that happen to things, we must reconceptualize things as “transient patterns” that convey to us a sense of stability.</p>

<p>Agency, identity, boundaries, and relations are not separate phenomena but co-constitutive aspects of the same dynamic process. Agency enables identity, boundaries, and relations by providing the dynamic through which things affect each other. Identity constrains agency by providing processual patterns that persist through affecting. Boundaries mediate agency by providing interfaces through which affecting occurs. Relations coordinate agency by providing scale-spanning patterns that nest affects across scales.</p>
<p>If we turn back to agency as a property, it requires yet another revision into a processual, energetic, and relational ontology, where via and because of phase-state mediators, coherence enables more coherence. We’re tracking with notions that tie not only past states to future ones, but also notions of unfolding. Sprouting discussions that surround Aristotelian efficient causation and the Daoist shi (勢) as the propensity of situations to unfold, we relate causation and unfolding as describing something that weaves spatiotemporal states.</p>
<p>This co-constitution explains why agency appears universal. It is not that everything “has” agency as a property, but that everything exists through patterns of affecting and being affected. Agency is the fundamental dynamic through which things relate, persist, and transform.</p>

<p>Based on empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, we define:</p>
<p><strong>Agency</strong>: The spatiotemporally distributed capacity of bounded relational systems to maintain coherent organizational identity while generating novel causal networks through selective boundary-mediated interactions across multiple scales. Agency manifests as the recursive mechanism by which bounded systems navigate the tension between maintaining coherent self-organization and enabling transformative relational exchange that creates new possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Agential Potential</strong>: The latent capacity for boundary-mediated relational transformation encoded in current organizational configurations. It represents the degree to which existing identity-boundary-relationship patterns can access novel organizational states through energy-informed selective interactions, creating networks of causal influence that connect past organizational achievements with future transformative possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Identity</strong>: The processual pattern of affecting and being affected that persists through time, maintained through coordinated boundary-mediated interactions that enable coherent self-renewal while allowing transformative change.</p>
<p><strong>Boundaries</strong>: Dynamic, semi-permeable interfaces that mediate how things affect each other; active, context-dependent phase-state mediators that filter, enable, and reshape the very interactions that constitute identity.</p>
<p><strong>Relations</strong>: Scale-spanning patterns of affecting that operate across nested spatiotemporal dimensions, exhibiting characteristic scaling laws that reveal universal constraints on how energy and information can be organized.</p>

<h2 data-number="16" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">16</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>Agency is not a property of agents but the fundamental dynamic through which things affect each other. This relational view explains the ubiquity of agency across scales and provides a framework for understanding how identity, boundaries, and relations operate through nested patterns of affecting. The polysemic nature of agency across disciplines reflects deep unity underlying apparent diversity of organizational phenomena—whether describing selective permeability of cellular membranes, bioelectric coordination of tissue regeneration, or institutional coordination of social action, we observe different manifestations of the same fundamental capacity.</p>
<p>We halted our study because we were seeing agency as a property of things, but did not know exactly how to describe a thing. From assembly morphology and potential there was a mechanistic and even computable approach which did not propose nor resolve questions of identity, persistence, relation and boundaries. Hence we are here now, relating work on identity boundaries and relations with previous work on agency.</p>
<p>By recognizing agency as relational dynamic rather than possessed property, we develop more precise accounts of how things persist, transform, and relate across the nested scales of biological, social, and physical organization. This framework provides tools for analyzing how affecting operates across scales in specific empirical contexts while maintaining theoretical precision about the co-constitutive relationship between agency, identity, boundaries, and relations.</p>
<p>The framework developed here opens new possibilities for understanding how things affect each other across the nested scales of natural and social organization, revealing agency as the universe’s fundamental mechanism for navigating the tension between autonomy and interdependence through recursive, boundary-mediated processes of becoming.</p>
