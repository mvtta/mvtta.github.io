We experience education in sequential steps, closed and determined, and are given information and instructions within a perspective of the immutability of reality. "Always was, always will be", sets a stage from where social order re-establishes itself for yet another generation.

Currently, education is given a high degree of importance, addressing three major domains:

1.  paralleled with some **future** economic value

2.  paramount for better **future** societies

3.  for an x% increase amount of life-**expectancy**

Amongst the immutability illusion, the doctrine of stability hinders and is dangerously close to the actual and permanent elimination of the core evolutionary device Humans have called learning ability.

Of course, modernity and the Industrial Revolution required literate workers to read the manuals, efficiently operate the machines, and assemble products, ensuring the life expectancy of the growing assembly line.
Before that, old clerics required new ones, creating literate minds to perpetuate the dogmatic pillars of societies.

These processes worked irrefutably then, and now, for a pair of decades, after two generations into the Industrial era, two wars eradicated the contextual roots that led to the newfound modernity, within the space-time continuum of existence.

A beginning was forged, and the past obliviated.

So, what we have is the 'life or death' decision to, no matter at what cost, participate in the system that produces a panoply of static socio-economic engines.

Given that formal education eradicates the **why** question from the equations, and there is a hungry mob of militants enforcing procedures and methods as doctrines, the addition of the **life or death** term, Educational institutions appear to be very effective at their crucial role in Humanity's self-destruction.

It's understandable if you disagree, but entertain the thought for a moment, what supports the argument won't take long to pass across, and does the reader have anything to lose?

### Argument
We are information processing systems, not machines, but systems, of systems of several degrees of agency. There are fantastical and mesmerizing processes of intra-systemic communication, and collaboration that address all scales and allow us to breathe out of our conscious decision stage.

"Ah, that is just physics", say most institutions.

So far, the argument is, that "Education is essential for "

1.  some **future** economic value

2.  somehow better **future** societies

3.   x% increase amount of life-**expectancy**

By:

1. Removing doubt, the **why** question, from a very young age, ensuring the replication of social order and forging the tacit agreements on fundamental truths for the next generation to come

2. Teaching complex systems to repeat the same static methods and externalizing processes, regardless of their dynamic nature

3. Promising those who adhere with dedication, and precision to the set of static methodologies, a vague idea of prosperity, health and wealth

Of course, the argument is not fully complete, but is important to juxtapose the information and lay the concurrent principles. 

It is important to say at this point, that I do not argue that education is bad, nor am I defending illiteracy, child mortality and poverty. The argument defends Education at its root, the **why** of which education itself exists, sets the tone for further analysis on the **meaning** propelling this perversion, leading to the institutionalization of what once was considered a duty, and is now turning it into a privilege, for the privilege of being able to exercise it. 

Transferring the information gathered to new generations, to optimize the learning process across long periods, inter-generational learning one may call it, seems to be an evolutionary mechanism developed to prevent extinction, as most life forms on our planet contain. Most species do it in ways we haven't been able to decode, as each system is limited by its perceptual range.

Recapping, our education system:

Education is essential for:

1.  some **future** economic value

2.  better **future** societies

3.  x% increase amount of life-**expectancy**

By:

1.  Removing doubt, the why, from a very young age, ensuring social order and forging tacit agreements of fundamental truths

2.  Teaching complex systems to repeat the same methods and processes on the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the universe

3.  Promissing those who adhere with dedication and precision and hypothetical better future, based on static doctrines and inductive biases.

4.  Being accessible exclusively for a discriminatory and deficient assessment of human potential

5.  Used as an ordering power weapon

6.  Obscuring and obstructing knowledge

7.  Proprietary

Evolution has its selection method, beyond Darwin's linearity. Humans decided to implement Educational systems in place that select who are the fittest by the wrong criteria, hindering the evolutionary process at its core, reducing its agency to -1 device, which took millions of years to evolve.

Humans did it in 100 years.

It's unfathomable that we didn't conceive seriously, at any period, that we know of, to question the nature of learning, why do we learn?
