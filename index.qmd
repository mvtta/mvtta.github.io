###  Hello, 


**Agency**: A series of articles and notes stemming from the central question "What is Agency?".
**Articles**: 
  * **Meaning**: A dedicated series to the question "What is meaning?".  
  * **Intelligence**: Thinking about Intelligence from an AI/ML perspective, some informal reviews on latest developments.  
  * **Other**: Articles & writings on other topics with a different tone.
**Experiments**: Some computational experiments. 
**Notebooks**: Explanations and technical notes
**Thoughts**: Short entries with unstructured and loose thoughts.
**Resource Tree**: Pointers and pins, an index to my current mind map of ideas and references. The purpose is dynamic, as I use the tree of information and links to share as a conversation propeller and contextual mapping to enrich dialogs.
