We experience education in sequential steps, closed and determined, and
are given information and instructions within a perspective of the
immutability of reality. ``Always was, always will be'', sets a stage
from where social order re-establishes itself for yet another
generation.

Currently education is given a high degree of importance, addressing
three major domains:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  paralleled with some \textbf{future} economic value
\item
  paramount for better \textbf{future} societies
\item
  for an x\% increase amount of life-\textbf{expectancy}
\end{enumerate}

Amongst the immutability illusion, the doctrine of stability hinders,
dangerously close to actual permanent eliminating the core evolutionary
device Humans have called learning ability.

Of course, modernity and the Industrial Revolution required literate
workers to read the manuals operate machines and assemble products
ensuring the life expectancy of the growing assembly line.\\
But before that, old clerics required new ones, literate minds to
perpetuate the dogmatic pillars of societies.

These devices worked irrefutably for a pair of decades, and after two
generations into the Industrial era, two wars eradicated the contextual
roots to fundament the newfound modernity within the space-time
continuum of existence.

So what we have is the life or death decision to no matter at what cost,
participate in the system of preparation of static socio-economic
devices.

Given that formal education eradicates the why questions from the
equations, and there is a hungry mob of militants enforcing procedures
and methods as doctrines, and there is a life or death term in that
equation, which legally would constitute an almost certain absolution
for any crime, education institutions are the most effective weapons
playing a crucial role leading to world destruction.

It's understandable if you disagree, but entertain the thought for a
moment, what supports the argument won't take long to pass across, and
does the reader have anything to lose:

We are information processing systems, not machines, but systems, of
systems of several degrees of agency. There are fantastical and
mesmerizing processes of intra-systemic communication, and collaboration
that address all scales and allow us to breathe out of our conscious
decision.

``Ah, that is just physics'', say all the institutions. But you probably
don't know that the origin of life is still a mystery, closer and closer
to being grasped, but that is another essay.

So far, the argument is made up of:

Education is essential for

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  some \textbf{future} economic value
\item
  better \textbf{future} societies
\item
  x\% increase amount of life-\textbf{expectancy}
\end{enumerate}

By:

1. Removing doubt, the why, from a very young age, ensuring social order
and forging tacit agreements of fundamental truths

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Teaching complex systems to repeat the same methods and processes on
  the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the universe
\end{enumerate}

3. Promissing those who adhere with dedication and precision and
hypothetical better future, based on static doctrines and inductive
biases.

Of course, the argument is not fully complete, but is important to
juxtapose the information and the principles laid out to re-check if it
makes sense. It is important to say at this point that I do not argue
that education is bad, nor am I defending illiteracy, child mortality
and poverty. The argument is made upon the premise of which education
was constituted in the first place., and of course the perversion of
incentives pushing the institutionalization of that duty, turning it
into a privilege.

But how was the incentive prevented in the first place?

Passing the information down to new generations, to optimize the
learning process across long periods, inter-generational learning one
may call it, is a evolutionary mechanism developed to prevent
extinction, as most life forms on our planet contain. Most species do it
in ways we haven't been able to decode, as each system is limited by its
perceptual range.

Recapping, our education system:

Education is essential for:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  some \textbf{future} economic value
\item
  better \textbf{future} societies
\item
  x\% increase amount of life-\textbf{expectancy}
\end{enumerate}

By:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Removing doubt, the why, from a very young age, ensuring social order
  and forging tacit agreements of fundamental truths
\item
  Teaching complex systems to repeat the same methods and processes on
  the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the universe
\item
  Promissing those who adhere with dedication and precision and
  hypothetical better future, based on static doctrines and inductive
  biases.
\item
  Being accessible exclusively for a discriminatory and deficient
  assessment of human potential
\item
  Used as an ordering power weapon
\item
  Obscuring and obstructing knowledge
\item
  Proprietary
\end{enumerate}

Evolution has its selection method, beyond Darwin's linearity. Humans
decided to implement Educational systems in place that select who are
the fittest by the wrong criteria, hindering the evolutionary process at
its core, reducing its agency to -1 device, which took millions of years
to evolve.

Humans did it in 100 years.

It's unfathomable that we didn't conceive seriously, at any period, that
we know of, to question the nature of learning, why do we learn?

I'm not an expert (break, to be continued )
