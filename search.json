This Open-Notebook is organized into the following categories:\n\nStaccato: Quick and unsorted daily notes. First transcribed from my physical notebooks. I may not fully transition to a digital-only format so the process analog ‚Äì&gt; digital may still apply in the future.\nOpen Notes: Notes developed/explored, or direct entries that assumed a longer format. They have no revision in argumentation, nor a formal structure.\nEssays: Notes that critically are (being) explored, hopefully, within reasonable and concise argumentation parameters. Can be tagged finished or work-in-progress. Perhaps it‚Äôs safer to assume that most of the content there is a potential essay.\nPoems: Self-explanatory.\nInfix: Pointers and pins, an index to my current mind map of ideas and references. The purpose is dynamic, as I use the tree of information and links to share as a conversation propeller and contextual mapping to enrich physical dialogs.\n\nIf you wish to have a conversation with me, my preferred method of contact is email"

    "text": "The tone of this essay is emotional, untethered, free from any format constraint. It has no destination but the message itself.\nTo pursue knowledge is to honor the gift of life. From our mothers to our ancestors, all of them, we owe it, to the past, ad continuum.\nIn the year 2023, in the christian time-stamp, we live in a period where wonder decayed into pessimism. Some would argue that this pessimism is a fruit directly ripped from the knowledge we seek, ‚Äúperhaps we man are evil beings‚Äù, ‚Äúa virus we are‚Äù.\nI strongly disagree, we are not evil, but ignorant.\nWe may think that we have far past the dark ages of mysticism, but the enlightenment wasn‚Äôt any cure for this malady that affects this global civilization.\nIgnorance, and only that. To attribute morality to natural objects is a clear indication that we, as Humans, have not entertained the connection between ourselves and all the other life-scales.\nFor now, we still haven‚Äôt perceived that life is a continuum, on which we are its part and agency. Not only Nature has birthed us, but has incumbent on us the majestic responsibility to act on its behalf.\nWe surely are not doing justice in this delegation of agency, perhaps because man chooses to oblivion, and dismisses the underlying mechanism, the logic behind agency in natural processes.\nMen and their perception need to identify the breadcrumbs left by our Mother, we are not a single thread, detached, checked out, the fruit of random causation.\nThere seems to be no evidence supporting randomness in natural iterative design, only a scope of possibilities given a certain state of constraints, future agency by exploratory and combinatorial means.\nWhat if we were to rejoice in the wonder? To achieve constructivism, we must first admit defeat.\nIgnorance is a blank page on a notebook, where we can shape the immaterial manifestation of all the mothers and the fathers, the seeds of knowledge leading to observations, sense-making, discovery and emergence.\nLet us put down the distractions, reject conformity and think. What we came to name ‚Äúthe mind‚Äù is an evolutionary device that has been developing since the beginning of life-time.\nLife-time seems to be a continuum, the stage where life is assembled by building blocks driven by potential, where actors of molecular intelligence, memory at the smallest scale, and atomic units of agency, lead to larger systems at play in the interconnectedness of all there is.\nIn the scenario of the above proposed, it is understandable our ignorance, and condemnation is easy but not useful.\n[unfinished] Porto, Portugal, 05:30 am"
