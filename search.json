    "text": "Incomprehensible man is,\nor most men seem to be,\nthose that crossed paths with the little Fox.\n\nIn the valley,\nat a far an\nA sharp lingers,\nsuspended\nechoes.\n\nAn ensemble of string instruments is weaving beauty.\nSome conduct,\nbut the shadow\nshapes the objects\ninto misanthropes.\nEven closer,\nwhat he could have nurtured,\ndidn’t grow,\na battered violin would not sound\nas all the triumphant mornings\nthere ever were,\nappended in perfection,\nbound by the multitude of voices\nthat never parted with the sight.\nThe fabric.\n\nThe little Fox weeps for Humanity,\nobjects, subjects and shells\nforgeries of empty cans filled with abundance,\nplastic permanence,\nshallow depictions of improbable pictures,\na future that delays itself.\nVultures,\nthey ache the division of space\nand shed tears in private,\nneglecting the flowers\nand flutes,\nunattended family jewels,\nsmiling and mourning simultaneously.\n\nScattered on the infertile soil,\nor the butcher’s marble countertop,\nfruits of sportive scavenge no flag to catch,\nno nation to defend, no heritage.\n\n\n\n\nThe little Fox begs:\n\nMaster,\nthis too is measurable!\nBy seeking precision,\nThy master has deprived himself of meaning,\nhe is starving!\n\nThe days in the cave were but an illusion,\nyet countable are the infinitesimal lives paving the road,\nelusive destinations to a Mad-Made future.\n\nIt's a trade of trust,\nIt's intertwined with the senses,\nminimizing uncertainty outside the container\nthy lord was brought into reason,\nis treason!\n\nWhere Master aims,\nis certain death,\nthis is not a threat\nneither is it poetry.\n\nSeize the glory of the Kingdom as one of us,\ncome,\naway and away from rust,\nlust, rulers and coils,\nthe clouds and the gods await you,\nas we all sojourn peace.\n\n\n\nThe master replies:\nCritter, I crave the cave where\nReality showed itself\nWhile the sun ticked my seconds\nIlluminated my endeavors!\nThese machinations aim only at restitution.\n\nAh, the memory of feeling \nA black and white plane\nwrapping the dark substance\nthat wears and tears, dust.\n\nMy eager hand in agile swifts\ntakes struggle away,\nthe stage must remain empty, \nas I do not need violins.\n\nAs long as there is no resonance in the concrete\nI've poured little Fox,\nno stain on my word shall exist:\n\nGo on,\nroam free,\nquickly,\ninto the forthcoming oblivion.\n\n\n\nThe little Fox now gazes towards an unknown destination,\nbaffled,\naghast,\nmade of the same matter,\nspeaking in tongs?\n\nFeelings have not defected the Fox,\nSadness reins in the peasant’s bed.\n\nConjured,\nradiating rings of fire\nburn through the grass,\nthe ants march in line down the valley\nconnecting weapons and heads.\n\nAll crowns to the trenches!\nThe ground trembles,\nstoic poses foresee the sudden discharge of betrayal.\n\nOn the ground now lies the little Fox\nwith the flute,\nand the violin,\nand the butcher’s wife,\nthe peasant’s daughter,\nflowers,\njewels,\nsilence.\nBodies,\nthe string of combustion is lit\nby the master backfire\nand he too shall perish tonight\nreturning the soil to the kings\nand queens of the land.\n\nHe disappears.\nFrom blue to orange,\nblack,\nsmall.\n\nSomething shines\nindistinguishable from coal,\ngold or slime.\nHeads or tails?\nNone,\nAshes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unapologetic sun woke\nAnd dried the wood to crack\nIf the night would just follow\nThe stiffness would crumble\nInstead, fire, turned a portal into a plane\nA rose into a monster\nSeeds into Humans\nMorality as a game.\n\nIf rain would just fall\nThe flames would tender\nInstead, wind, turned charcoal into chaos\nMountains into buildings\nFertility into a bitter poison\nThat turned life against life.\n\nOne could blame many\nAs the breeze.\nOr the sun,\nBut the one who kept the key\nWalked away.\n\n\n\n\nThe empty\nThe scene\nHow hard\nAnd how slippery\nIt is to grasp\nThis Intangible and demeaning\nThe indefinite continuum\nOf senseless words\nThis show of shadows\nAnd superficial desires\nVoided of meaning\nAnd brimming of near truths\nThe pretentious unpretentious\nOf what once felt\nWas an appropriate part.\n\n\n\n\nI don’t know what to do\nWhere to start?\nTo do for others my body goes\nmy mind follows\nto do for me\nA rigid body.\n\n\n\n\nFor years\nAll that was

drought no more loneliness\nfor the small cactus.\n241120\n\n\n\nThere is a place that does not fully exist,\nwhere you live.\n\nA place where thoughts\nand guts get intertwined.\n\nA place where there’s only room for parts,\nmirrors.\n\nThere is yet another place\nwhere the grounding forces reside,\nwhere one rests.\n\nIn the soil,\nintestines are roots.\nQuintessence,\ninside the

you ended the conversation,\nI wish I had better skills to engage you in the discussion.\n\nI disagree with your premise,\ndo you care to elaborate?\nWait, let’s talk more.\n\n\n\n\nLooking up at her against the blue sky\nwith her blue eyes\nskin glazed with time,\ncloseness, love.\n\nFearless, within her world.\nThe weather was pleasant and soft.\n\nExperience transcends formulation,\nthere is no

    "text": "Why an Open Notebook?\nContemplating mortality I came to realize, regarding personal physical notebooks, that the resistance to share my thoughts ideas openly was missaligned and with the very core and reason of why, as Humans, we’re given the ability to convey meaning, communicate, learn and invent.\nAs a consequence, and from now on, most of my note-taking is alocated here, and the experiment begins. This Open-Notebook is organized into the following categories:\n\nStaccato: Quick and unsorted daily notes. First transcribed from my physical notebooks. I may not fully transition to a digital-only format so the process analog –&gt; digital may still apply in the future.\nOpen Notes: Notes developed/explored, or direct entries that assumed a longer format. They have no revision in argumentation, nor a formal structure.\nEssays: Notes that critically are (being) explored, hopefully, within reasonable and concise argumentation parameters. Can be tagged finished or work-in-progress. Perhaps it’s safer to assume that most of the content there is a potential essay.\nPoems: Self-explanatory.\nInfix: Pointers and pins, an index to my current mind map of ideas and references. The purpose is dynamic, as I use the tree of information and links to share as a conversation propeller and contextual mapping to enrich physical dialogs.\n\nIf you wish to have a conversation with me, my preferred method of contact is email"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The tone of this essay is emotional, untethered, free from any format constraint. It has no destination but the message itself.\nTo pursue knowledge is to honor the gift of life. From our mothers to our ancestors, all of them, we owe it, to the past, ad continuum.\nIn the year 2023, in the christian time-stamp, we live in a period where wonder decayed into pessimism. Some would argue that this pessimism is a fruit directly ripped from the knowledge we seek, “perhaps we man are evil beings”, “a virus we are”.\nI strongly disagree, we are not evil, but ignorant.\nWe may think that we have far past the dark ages of mysticism, but the enlightenment wasn’t any cure for this malady that affects this global civilization.\nIgnorance, and only that. To attribute morality to natural objects is a clear indication that we, as Humans, have not entertained the connection between ourselves and all the other life-scales.\nFor now, we still haven’t perceived that life is a continuum, on which we are its part and agency. Not only Nature has birthed us, but has incumbent on us the majestic responsibility to act on its behalf.\nWe surely are not doing justice in this delegation of agency, perhaps because man chooses to oblivion, and dismisses the underlying mechanism, the logic behind agency in natural processes.\nMen and their perception need to identify the breadcrumbs left by our Mother, we are not a single thread, detached, checked out, the fruit of random causation.\nThere seems to be no evidence supporting randomness in natural iterative design, only a scope of possibilities given a certain state of constraints, future agency by exploratory and combinatorial means.\nWhat if we were to rejoice in the wonder? To achieve constructivism, we must first admit defeat.\nIgnorance is a blank page on a notebook, where we can shape the immaterial manifestation of all the mothers and the fathers, the seeds of knowledge leading to observations, sense-making, discovery and emergence.\nLet us put down the distractions, reject conformity and think. What we came to name “the mind” is an evolutionary device that has been developing since the beginning of life-time.\nLife-time seems to be a continuum, the stage where life is assembled by building blocks driven by potential, where actors of molecular intelligence, memory at the smallest scale, and atomic units of agency, lead to larger systems at play in the interconnectedness of all there is.\nIn the scenario of the above proposed, it is understandable our ignorance, and condemnation is easy but not useful.\n[unfinished] Porto, Portugal, 05:30 am"
