    "text": "Key Topics: Error Correction, Hashing & Maps\n\n\n\nCurrent bottlenecks along AI/ML pipelines, that can be complex, extensive and costly. As an illustration of what a general sequence / elementary processes (pipeline) of an AI/ML model looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR;\n    A[Data Collection] --&gt; B[Preprocessing];\n    B --&gt; C[Feature Extraction];\n    C --&gt; D[Model Training];\n    D --&gt; E[Evaluation];\n    E --&gt; F[Deployment];\n\n    style A fill:#fff,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px,rx:10,ry:10,color:#000\n    style B fill:#fff,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px,rx:10,ry:10,color:#000\n    style C fill:#fff,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px,rx:10,ry:10,color:#000\n    style D fill:#fff,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px,rx:10,ry:10,color:#000\n    style E fill:#fff,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px,rx:10,ry:10,color:#000\n    style F fill:#fff,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px,rx:10,ry:10,color:#000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of image generation, an easily relatable use-case scenario of AI/ML, it seems that the trend is optimizing these various stages of the process. First, an illustration of what it a general sequence / elementary processes (pipeline) of an AI/ML model:\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR;\n    A[Input Data] --&gt; B[Noise Addition];\n    B --&gt; C[Generator Network];\n    C --&gt; D[Discriminator Network];\n    D --&gt; E[Output Image];\n\n    style A fill:#fff,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px,rx:10,ry:10,color:#000\n    style B fill:#fff,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px,rx:10,ry:10,color:#000\n    style C fill:#fff,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px,rx:10,ry:10,color:#000\n    style D fill:#fff,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px,rx:10,ry:10,color:#000\n    style E fill:#fff,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px,rx:10,ry:10,color:#000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage generation is a good example of cross-dependency by its multidisciplinary nature. Bottlenecks and pain-points are popular expressions that concern a general idea: Problems. And what can you do with problems? Fix them. Solving one issue versus solving the problem seems to be the main pitfall companies developing AI and tech products, because while it keeps teams busy and immediate rewards of resolving small issues, the architectural problem may not be addressed, and if they were, solving one problem could potentially resolve n more issues.\nWhile architectural problems are of interested, they deserve an entire article (or several) to address them in more detail. For now, we may focus on one tangible questions that most (a range of technical and general audiences) can follow and leverage from the information here shared:\nWhat efforts are in place to address existing issues?\n\n\n\nIf we perceive the flow of information and processes through the pipeline as a signal, a phone call, it’s easy to intuit how it is naturally prone to errors, loss, miss-calculations and interferences in the process. Most of us know what is the Telephone game, or the Whispers game, where “which messages are whispered from person to person and then the original and final messages are compared.”. Now imagine that everyone involved is dedicated to really passing the message accurately, but since they speak different languages, this will have a degree of on influence on how the message will be transmitted.\nFor decades, and actually very important in actual phone-calls are error correction codes, and they are widely used in software development as well.\nThe concepts of error correction codes, Hamming codes, and hashing in AI/ML, have shared origins with information theory, and although a broad and historically rich research topics, and in spite their complexity, conceptually they are simple to gain some initial intuition on:\nImagine error correction codes as a protective shield or a self-healing fabric wrapped around data (or the message of the Telephone Game analogy above). Just as a self-healing material can repair small tears or damages, error correction codes allow data to recover from minor corruptions during transmission, or even aid the encoder fill in the gaps if data is missing. Hamming codes, in this analogy, are like a specialized patch on this fabric, designed to detect and mend specific types of tears efficiently.\nThis allows us to consider how error correction techniques play a significant role in speeding up input / output operations, feature retrieval and optimize memory usage.\nHashing, on the other hand, can be viewed as a form of data compression or approximation. It’s akin to creating a thumbnail of an image, how much information is necessary to be passed around? A smaller representation that captures the essence of the original sometimes is enough. A smiley face emoji does not need to be yellow if the intent is to answer is it smiling? : yes or no?\nIn traditional computing, this thumbnail aims for uniqueness, like a fingerprint. But in AI/ML applications, it’s more like an impressionist painting, capturing the semantic essence rather than exact details.\nThe evolution of these concepts in AI/ML, particularly in cross-modal hashing and joint Hamming spaces, is like creating a universal language or a common currency for different types of information. It’s as if we’re translating diverse data types: text, images, audio; into a shared alphabet, where similarities can be easily compared regardless of their original form.\nAll these techniques, at their core, are about efficient representation and manipulation of information. They share a common ancestry in information theory and the fundamental challenge of encoding, transmitting, and decoding data accurately and efficiently. Whether it’s protecting against errors, creating compact representations, or enabling cross-modal comparisons, these methods are different expressions of the same underlying principle: finding optimal ways to handle and process information in a world of imperfect channels, biases, and diverse data types.\nIn this shared universe analogy, for specialized and customized models, the range of data is somehow related. Visual culture has eras, styles etc. Thus, the Hamming distance of “A woman riding a horse on a prairie” and a “Woman sitting on a porch chair” if the model is specialized in Renascence paintings generation, is small, and their corresponding binary codes shall be small too (Chen et al. 2024b). Thus, joint Hamming spaces allow for a both text and images to be correlated, and their relationship strength to be update given the model’s learning ability.\n\n——— et al. 2024b. “Enhancing Cross-Modal Retrieval via Visual-Textual Prompt Hashing.” In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence. Vol. 69.\nHighlighting the most recent and used encoders:\n- TIME: The TIME (Text-to-Image Model Editing) method can efficiently correct biases in image generator models by editing only about 1.95% of the model’s parameters (Mokady et al., 2023).\n- ReFACT: While ReFACT achieves even more precise results by tweaking just 0.25% of parameters while maintaining image quality (Ruiz et al., 2023).\n\n\n\n\nVisual-Textual Prompt Hashing (VTPH): Chen et al. (2024) which integrates both visual and textual prompt learning into cross-modal hashing, addressing limitations like context loss and information redundancy in existing methods. This facilitates semantic coherence between diverse modalities, improving cross-modal retrieval performance.\nMulti-Grained Similarity Preserving and Updating (MGSPU): By (Wu et al. 2024) this unsupervised cross-modal hashing approach combines multi-grained similarity information from local and global views to improve the accuracy of similarity measurements and preserve similarity consistency across modalities.\nMulti-Dimensional Feature Fusion Hashing (MDFFH): (Chen et al. 2024a) proposed the Multi-Dimensional Feature Fusion Hashing (MDFFH), where it constructs multi-dimensional fusion modules in image and text networks to learn multi-dimensional semantic features of data, integrating Vision Transformer with convolution neural networks to fuse local and global information.\nSemantic Embedding-based Online Cross-modal Hashing (SEOCH): Proposed by (Liu et al. 2024) SEOCH addresses the challenges of online learning for streaming data in cross-modal hashing by mapping semantic labels to a latent semantic space and employing a discrete optimization strategy for online hashing.\nHamming Code-Based Hashing: By (Hinton 2023), this approach leverages the error correction efficiency and simplicity of Hamming codes to enhance data integrity in hash-based systems.\n\n\n\n\nWu, Z. et al. 2024. “Multi-Grained Similarity Preserving and Updating for Unsupervised Cross-Modal Hashing.” Applied Sciences 14 (2): 870.\n\nChen, B. et al. 2024a. “Cross-Modal Retrieval Based on Multi-Dimensional Feature Fusion Hashing.” Frontiers in Physics 12: 1379873.\n\nLiu, Y. et al. 2024. “Semantic Embedding Based Online Cross-Modal Hashing Method.” Scientific Reports 14 (1): 1379873.\n\nHinton, G. 2023. “The Case for Digital over Analog Computation in AI.”"

    "section": "2.1 2. Some Theoretical & Foundational Ideas",
    "text": "2.1 2. Some Theoretical & Foundational Ideas\n\n2.1.1 Mereology\nMereology, derived from the Greek word “meros” meaning part, provides the theoretical foundation for understanding part-whole relationships. Originally formalized by Polish logician Stanisław Leśniewski in the early 20th century, mereology has evolved into a means of computationally analyzing component interactions of a system while formalizing belonging without sets, using predicates like \\(P(x, y)\\) x is a part of y governed by axioms (e.g., transitivity, irreflexivity).\nClassical Extensional Mereology (CEM) establishes several fundamental principles governing part-whole relationships: - Transitivity: If A is part of B, and B is part of C, then A is part of C. - Irreflexivity: No entity is a proper part of itself (\\(\\neg P(x, x)\\)). - Antisymmetry: If A is part of B and B is part of A, then A and B are identical.\nThese axioms prevent Russell-like contradictions by enforcing hierarchical composition. For instance, a cell ($ x\\() may belong to a tissue (\\)y$), but tissues cannot recursively belong to cells. Giorgio Lando emphasized that, CEM represents “a highly general theory of parthood and composition” applicable primarily to concrete, spatiotemporal entities (Lando, 2017).\nMereology also illuminates different types of part-whole relationships. Almeida and Baracho identify several distinct categories:\n\nComponent-Object relations (wheel-car)\nMember-Collection relations (tree-forest)\nMaterial-Object relations (steel-car)\nStage-Process relations (childhood-life)\nLocality-Region relations (oasis-desert)\n\nAdditionally, Proper parts contribute to wholes without self-reference, as a cell’s organelles (parts) interact to sustain the cell (whole), but no organelle is the cell.\nThe Axiom here is: (irreflexivity) \\[\n\\forall x \\forall y \\, [P(x, y) \\to \\neg P(y, x)]\n\\]\nLando carefully distinguishes mereology from logic, arguing that while the former might appear to possess logical necessity, it remains a problematic metaphysical doctrine that requires careful application.\nHowever problematic it may seem, the problem appears self-informing of the relevance in formalizing how something comes to be (and persists!).\nThis question touches on deep and nuanced concepts about identity, self-referencing, relationships between entities, and how things are defined in relation to themselves and others. How something relates to something other than itself required clarification.\nBy something, in logical and philosophical terms, is an entity or object that exists or can be defined. It has properties or characteristics that distinguish it from other entities.For example: A set, a person, a number, or a physical object. Naturally, something other than itself refers to entities that are distinct from the something we just described. These are objects that do not share the exact identity of the first entity. For example, if something is a set $ A $, then something other than itself refers to all entities $ x $ such that $ x A $.\n\n\n2.1.2 Categories\nWhile mereology formalizes belonging, category theory formalizes interaction through morphisms, directional maps between objects. In category theory, an object’s identity emerges not from intrinsic properties but from its position within a network of morphisms. As Mac Lane notes, we understand objects “up to isomorphism,” meaning identity arises from relational structure rather than essence.\nThis formalization reveals that coherent systems require: 1. Composition: interfaces combine predictably If $f: A B $ and $ g: B C $, then $ g f: A C $\n\nIdentity: objects maintain self-relation For each object \\(A\\), there exists $_A: A A $\nAssociativity: interactions chain consistently $h (g f) = (h g) f $\n\nThese properties ensure that categorical interfaces, unlike naive set theory, cannot generate paradoxes. A cell membrane, modeled as $: $, maintains directional flow without circular reference, preventing the equivalent of \\(R \\in R\\).\n\n\n2.1.3 Combining Ideas\nRussell’s paradox presents a dilemma: either abandon self-reference entirely or incorporate it as a controlled, non-circular process. Natural systems demonstrate the latter approach through structured redundancy: self-reference bounded by termination conditions.\nThe synthesis of mereology and category theory yields a framework for understanding interfaces as structural mediators between parts and wholes:\nIn precise terms, we can formalize interfaces through the complementary logics of mereology and category theory:\n\nMereological Belonging: Parts belong to wholes through proper parthood (\\(P(x, y)\\)), governed by:\n\nTransitivity: \\(\\forall x,y,z [P(x,y) \\land P(y,z) \\rightarrow P(x,z)]\\)\nAsymmetry: \\(\\forall x,y [P(x,y) \\rightarrow \\neg P(y,x)]\\)\nIrreflexivity: \\(\\forall x [\\neg P(x,x)]\\) (no entity is a proper part of itself)\n\nCategorical Interaction: Parts interact with their complements through morphisms (\\(f: x \\to y \\setminus x\\)), where:\n\nComposition: \\(\\forall f: A \\to B, g: B \\to C, \\exists (g \\circ f): A \\to C\\)\nIdentity: \\(\\forall A, \\exists \\text{id}_A: A \\to A\\)\nAssociativity: \\(\\forall f,g,h [(h \\circ g) \\circ f = h \\circ (g \\circ f)]\\)\n\n\nWe define an interface between part \\[ x \\] and whole \\[ y \\]. For any part \\(x\\) of whole \\(y\\), the interface \\(I(x, y)\\) represents the set of all interactions between \\(x\\) and its complement \\(y \\setminus x\\). From these axioms, we derive a fundamental theorem:\n\\[\nI(x, y) = \\{ f \\mid f: x \\to y \\setminus x \\},\n\\]\nwhere \\[ y \\setminus x \\] denotes the complement of \\[ x \\] within \\[ y \\]. This yields a critical theorem:\nTheorem (Non-Recursive Interaction):\nIf \\[ P(x, y) \\], then \\[ \\neg \\exists f: y \\to x \\].\nProof Sketch: Follows from mereological irreflexivity. If \\[ f: y \\to x \\] existed, \\[ x \\] would indirectly belong to itself (\\[ P(x, y) \\] and \\[ P(y, x) \\]), violating \\[ \\neg P(x, x) \\].\nSuppose \\(P(x, y)\\) and there exists a morphism \\(f: y \\to x\\). By mereological asymmetry, we know \\(\\neg P(y, x)\\). However, the existence of \\(f: y \\to x\\) would imply a categorical relationship where \\(y\\) influences \\(x\\) directly, violating the hierarchical nature of the part-whole relationship. This contradiction establishes the theorem. \\(\\square\\)\nExample: Mitochondria (\\[ x \\]) interact with their cellular environment (\\[ y \\setminus x \\]) via respiration (\\[ f: x \\to y \\setminus x \\]), but no morphism allows the cell (\\[ y \\]) to recursively regulate the mitochondrion (\\[ x \\]).\nThis constraint prevents paradoxical loops: mitochondria interface with cells through respiratory pathways, but cells cannot recursively interface with their own mitochondria without violating hierarchical integrity."

    "text": "2.2 3. Interface as Paradox Resolver\nRussell’s paradox forces a choice: either abandon self-reference entirely or incorporate it as a controlled, non-circular process / constrain it within structured boundaries. Nature consistently demonstrates the latter strategy through what we might call “bounded self-reference”—feedback systems with well-defined termination conditions.\nConsider these contrasting forms of self-reference:\n\nParadoxical (Unbounded): The set \\(R = \\{x \\mid x \\not\\in x\\}\\) leads to contradiction: \\(R \\in R \\iff R \\not\\in R\\).\nProductive (Bounded): The Fibonacci sequence defined by \\(F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)\\) with base cases \\(F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1\\) generates a coherent sequence despite self-reference.\n\nThe crucial distinction lies in boundary conditions: productive self-reference incorporates limits that prevent infinite regress.\nBiological systems implement bounded self-reference through homeostatic mechanisms. homeostasis exemplifies productive self-reference. Cellular membranes (\\[ I(x, y) \\]) detect environmental changes (e.g., pH shifts) and trigger responses (e.g., ion transport) until equilibrium is restored. These systems avoid infinite loops through electrochemical thresholds—natural termination conditions encoded in membrane potential dynamics.\nConsider ion channel dynamics. When intracellular calcium levels rise, calcium-activated potassium channels open, hyperpolarizing the membrane and reducing calcium influx—a negative feedback loop with precise termination conditions (Hille, 2001). This self-regulatory pathway prevents calcium overload while maintaining functional signaling.\nLevin’s research on developmental bioelectricity reveals how cellular collectives coordinate through voltage gradients. These gradients form what Levin and Martyniuk (2018: 83) term “a morphogenetic code” mediating between genetic instructions and anatomical outcomes. Unlike uncontrolled growth (cancer), normal morphogenesis includes precise termination signals: bioelectric patterns change when target morphology is achieved, stopping further division and differentiation.\nThe concept of “self” in cellular contexts manifests without explicit self-awareness. As Levin (2021: 93) notes: “Cells do not need to know that they are part of a kidney; they simply respond to the local biophysical cues that result from their neighbors’ activities.” This localized interaction at boundaries—interfacial communication—enables collective behavior without centralized control.\nDevelopmental bioelectricity demonstrates how cellular collectives coordinate morphogenesis through voltage gradients. These are particularly interesting because the sense of “self” of a cell and participatory belonging seem to be present and do not seem to require compositional awareness, Is made through proximity, happens at the shared boundaries, as bioelectric interfaces form what Levin and Martyniuk (2018: 83) call a morphogenetic code acting as a layer of control between genotype and phenotype. Unlike unrestricted self-reference, this bioelectric feedback includes termination conditions—cells stop dividing when target morphology is achieved. Also, cellular collectives coordinate via bioelectric gradients. These voltage patterns act as morphisms (\\[ \\text{Voltage}: \\text{Cell} \\to \\text{Tissue} \\]), guiding anatomical development (Levin & Martyniuk, 2018).\nThe immune system offers a particularly instructive example of paradox resolution through interfaces. To function correctly, immune cells must distinguish “self” from “non-self”—a biological implementation of set membership determination.\nJaneway’s seminal work on pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) demonstrated how this discrimination occurs through interfacial recognition: toll-like receptors on immune cells recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) absent from host tissues (Janeway, 1989). This molecular interface prevents the paradox of autoimmunity—the immunological equivalent of Russell’s contradiction—by establishing clear boundaries between self and non-self.\nThe immune system distinguishes self from non-self through T-cell receptors (TCRs). These protein interfaces (\\[ f: \\text{TCR} \\to \\text{Antigen} \\]) bind to foreign peptides while ignoring self-proteins, preventing autoimmune attacks (Janeway et al., 2001). This process mirrors axiomatic set theory’s resolution of Russell’s paradox: self-reference is permitted only within bounded interfaces. Here, the “self” from “non-self” to protect the organism without attacking its own tissues. This discrimination occurs through interfacial recognition: receptors on immune cells bind to antigens in ways that prevent autoimmune cascades. The system maintains boundaries that allow self-monitoring without self-destruction—a biological implementation of interfacial logic.\nWhat makes this system remarkable is its adaptive capacity without logical collapse. As Tonegawa’s research on V(D)J recombination showed, B-cells generate billions of unique antibody configurations, yet maintain self-tolerance through negative selection—eliminating cells that react to self-antigens (Tonegawa, 1983). This process embodies bounded self-reference: the system examines itself without attacking itself.\n\n2.2.1 Pathological Interfaces: Cancer as Disconnection\nWhen interfaces fail, pathologies emerge. Levin’s research (2022) offers a compelling interpretation of cancer as an interfacial breakdown: cancer cells disconnect from the collective bioelectric network, reverting to a solitary state where they compete for survival rather than contribute to the organism. This perspective reframes cancer not merely as genetic mutation but as interfacial disruption—cells that no longer recognize their place within the whole.\nRemarkably, Levin’s team demonstrated that manipulating bioelectric interfaces can sometimes “reconnect” cancer cells to the organismal network. By modulating voltage gradients through ion channel manipulation, they induced metastatic melanoma cells to revert to normal behavior (Chernet & Levin, 2013). This intervention demonstrates the causal role of interfaces in maintaining hierarchical integrity.\nUnderstanding interfacing principles thus seem to allow conditioning at scales in which are outside of our own interfacing capabilities and perceptual range.\n\n\n2.2.2 Computational Implementations of Bounded Self-Reference\nThe clear computational analog, when systems similarly avoid paradoxes through structured interfaces in recursion.\nIn computer science, interfaces enforce termination:\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:  # Base case (interface)\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\nThe base case acts as an interface, halting recursion and preventing stack overflows. This function references itself but includes a termination condition (the base case), preventing infinite recursion.\nRecursive functions like factorial or tree traversal include base cases that terminate said recursion. Neural networks employ skip connections and normalization layers to prevent gradient explosion or vanishing, manifestations of computational paradoxes.\nResidual networks (ResNets) employ skip connections that allow signals to bypass layers, preventing gradient problems during training. As He et al. (2016) demonstrated, these architectural interfaces enable network depth without performance degradation.\nModern architectures use interfaces to stabilize training:\n- Skip Connections: Allow gradients to bypass layers, preventing vanishing/exploding values (ResNet, He et al., 2016).\n- Attention Mechanisms: In AlphaFold 3, attention layers (\\[ f: \\text{Sequence} \\to \\text{Structure} \\]) predict protein folding by constraining interactions to biophysically plausible conformations (Jumper et al., 2023).\nAlphaFold 3’s breakthrough protein structure prediction relies on attention interfaces that selectively filter information between network layers (Jumper et al., 2023). These mechanisms implement bounded self-reference: each layer attends to previous layers’ outputs without creating recursive loops.\nThis reframing transforms Russell’s paradox into a design principle: self-reference becomes productive when structured through interfaces with clear termination conditions.\n\n\n2.2.3 The Operational Principle: Structured Boundaries Enable Complexity\n\nHierarchical Separation: Enforce \\[ \\neg P(x, x) \\] through boundaries (e.g., cell membranes, constitutional checks).\n\nDirectional Flow: Use morphisms \\[ f: A \\to B \\] to mediate exchanges without recursion.\n\nTermination Conditions: Implement thresholds (e.g., voltage potentials, base cases) to halt feedback loops.\n\nThese constraints shape everything from molecular signaling to cognitive processes to computational algorithms. Whether in cellular collectives organizing tissues or neural networks classifying images, interfaces establish the conditions under which parts can interact without losing their distinct identities.\nAs Hofstadter (1979) observed in “Gödel, Escher, Bach,” structured self-reference—what he called “strange loops”—enables rather than undermines complexity when properly bounded. Russell’s paradox thus reveals not merely a logical trap but a fundamental principle of organized complexity: structured boundaries act as mediators transforming potential contradictions into productive relationships. Underpin fields from synthetic biology to AI, proving that interfaces are not mere abstractions but the operational logic of complex systems."

    "text": "2.3 4. Nature’s Insights\n\n2.3.1 Morphology as Interfacial Code\nFrom the helical twist of DNA to the fractal branching of lungs the shape of things, their morphology seem to encode interaction potential, dictating how entities interface with their environments across hierarchical scales. These shapes are self-informing of means of interaction given their interface, they embody the very means of engagement between entities.\nProteins exemplify morphology-as-interface. A kinase’s active site adopts a 3D structure geometrically complementary to its substrate—a lock-and-key mechanism where shape determines binding specificity. This principle underpins AlphaFold’s success: by predicting a protein’s folded structure from its amino acid sequence, AlphaFold 3 infers interaction partners with atomic precision (Jumper et al., 2023). The relationship between sequence (parts) and structure (whole) follows Anfinsen’s dogma: proteins fold into minimal free-energy configurations, optimizing interfacial efficiency (Anfinsen, 1973).\nContrary to what some may think, form and function in Nature seem to “work” together as morphological shapes often serve interfacial efficiency. The folded inner membrane of Mitochondrial Cristae increases surface area for respiratory enzyme activity, maximizing ATP production. In Lung Alveoli, fractal branching maximizes gas exchange surface while minimizing diffusion distance. Neural Dendrites branch out in patterns that optimise input reception while maintaining signal integrity.\nThese morphologies solve interfacial constraints through geometric innovation, recursion, and so on, Fractal structures like lung bronchioles or vascular networks resolve the “square-cube law” problem by maintaining surface-to-volume ratios across scales, enabling efficient resource distribution without paradoxical scaling.\nThese shapes emerge through bioelectric morphogenesis, where cellular collectives negotiate form via voltage gradients (Levin, 2021). The resulting structures are self-informing: morphology encodes historical interactions while constraining future ones.\n\n\n2.3.2 Morphology, Perception, and Evolution: Interfaces as Adaptive Filters Perceptual\nOur perceptual systems demonstrate how morphology shapes interfacial processing. Vision—a paradigm of perceptual interfacing—reveals how neural morphology dictates experiential “shape.” The retina’s photoreceptor mosaic (rods and cones) samples light through a hexagonal grid, a morphological solution to packaging efficiency. This grid structure, preserved through multiple synaptic layers, shapes perceived visual fields as topological maps in V1.\nDonald Hoffman’s Interface Theory of Perception suggests that perceptual morphology prioritizes fitness over truth. Our binocular vision’s narrow 120° field sacrifices panoramic awareness for stereoscopic depth—a morphological trade-off optimizing primate arboreal navigation (Hoffman, 2019). This evolutionary shaping of perceptual interfaces demonstrates how morphology encodes interaction potential while constraining future possibilities.\nThe integration of mereology, Interface Theory of Perception, and TAME reveals compelling theoretical intersections with profound implications for our understanding of interfaces across domains. Hoffman’s interface theory can be understood through mereological principles. Our perceptual interfaces create specific part-whole relationships that may not reflect objective reality but nonetheless seem to allow organization and predict structural integrity, and that hypothetically serve adaptive purposes.\nThe synergy between ITP, mereology, and TAME redefines ontological assumptions:\n- ITP: Perceptual categories (e.g., “object”) are fitness-enhancing interfaces, not reality’s ground truth.\n- TAME: Cognitive systems arise from part-whole collaborations, not centralized controllers.\n- Mereology: Wholes derive identity from structured interactions, not intrinsic essence.\nMulti-scale competency resonates with mereological concepts of composition, and suggests that cognitive systems are likely to stem from the composition of parts into wholes. As Almeida and Baracho note, “The system is a structural connection of its elements. Its basic formal characteristic is that elements do not simply enter the system, but enter it as a result of interaction with other elements”. All three frameworks challenge conventional ontological assumptions. Mereology questions whether wholes constitute additional ontological commitments beyond their parts. Interface theory suggests that our ontological categories may be species-specific constructions rather than reflections of objective reality. TAME proposes that cognitive properties exist across a continuous spectrum rather than as discrete categories. Together, these frameworks suggest a more fluid, empirically-grounded approach to ontology that emphasizes functional relationships and pragmatic modeling over rigid categorical distinctions. This approach may better accommodate the diverse phenomena encountered across natural and engineered systems. The exploration of mereology, Interface Theory of Perception, and TAME reveals complementary perspectives on how interfaces function across physical, perceptual, and cognitive domains.\nThe retina’s photoreceptor mosaic samples light through a hexagonal grid, a configuration proven by mathematical packing theory to maximize spatial coverage (\\[ \\sim 90\\% \\] efficiency) while minimizing wiring costs (Snyder et al., 1977). This grid propagates through synaptic layers, shaping topological maps in the visual cortex (V1) that preserve spatial relationships—a principle first codified by Hubel and Wiesel’s orientation columns (Hubel & Wiesel, 1962).\nHoffman’s ITP posits that perceptual systems evolved as “species-specific desktops,” favoring fitness over veridicality. Primate binocular vision illustrates this: a narrow 120° field sacrifices panoramic awareness for stereoscopic depth, optimizing arboreal navigation. The morphological constraints of ocular spacing (\\[ \\sim 6 \\, \\text{cm} \\] in humans) directly determine depth perception limits through the disparity equation:\n\\[  \n\\Delta \\theta = \\frac{b \\cdot \\Delta d}{d^2}  \n\\]\nwhere \\[ b \\] is interocular distance, and \\[ d \\] is object distance (Howard & Rogers, 1995).\nMereological principles govern biological hierarchies:\n- Irreflexivity: A cell (\\[ x \\]) cannot belong to itself (\\[ \\neg P(x, x) \\]).\n- Transitivity: Mitochondria (\\[ x \\]) belong to cells (\\[ y \\]), which belong to tissues (\\[ z \\]), hence \\[ P(x, z) \\].\nThese axioms prevent paradoxical loops, ensuring scalable organization."

    "text": "2.4 5. Hierarchical Cooperation Through Interfaces\n\n2.4.1 Bioelectric Coordination\nMichael Levin’s research on developmental bioelectricity reveals how cellular collectives coordinate through bioelectric interfaces to achieve system-level goals. Cells communicate via ion gradients, forming morphogenetic interfaces that guide tissue development (Levin, 2021). These interfaces enable collective intelligence, allowing cells to solve problems (e.g., regenerating limbs) no single cell could manage.\nThis bioelectric code functions as “an ancient computational medium for dynamic control of growth and form” (Levin & Martyniuk, 2018). Voltage gradients serve as interfaces that coordinate collective cellular behavior, enabling “multi-scale competency” where higher-order patterns emerge from local interactions. These bioelectric interfaces resolve potential paradoxes by enforcing clear boundaries between levels of organization while enabling higher-order agency to emerge.\n\n\n2.4.2 Institutional Interfaces & Nested Collaboration at Scale\nSocial institutions similarly employ interfaces to enable hierarchical cooperation. Democratic governance implements mereological interfaces through checks and balances. Separation of powers—executive, legislative, judicial—prevents any branch from self-regulating ($P(x, x) $), creating interfaces where power flows directionally without circular authority.\nMarket systems function through price interfaces that coordinate decentralized decision-making. As Benjamin Lyons explores, prices act as “cognitive glue” binding disparate economic agents into coherent supply chains without centralized control. These price interfaces resolve potential coordination paradoxes by providing clear signals without allowing recursive manipulation.\nThe Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere (TAME) framework suggests that agency manifests across scales through proper composition. TAME characterizes cognition through three capabilities: pursuing goals, owning compound memories, and serving as the locus for credit assignment. Crucially, these capabilities must operate at scales larger than possible for component parts alone, creating emergent cognitive systems.\nThis nested agency depends on interfacial coordination. Slime molds demonstrate non-neural cognitive capacities by externalizing spatial memory through secreted chemicals. Reid et al. (2012) documented Physarum polycephalum navigating complex environments by depositing chemical markers—an interface between organism and environment that prevents redundant exploration. This externalized memory exemplifies interfacial cognition: information processing occurs at the boundary between organism and world, not solely within internal structures.\nInterfaces enable collaboration to scale across levels of organization by maintaining boundary integrity while allowing regulated interaction. Biological systems demonstrate this principle through nested interfaces:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nInterface Type\nCollaboration Function\n\n\n\n\nMolecular\nProtein-protein binding\nMetabolic pathway coordination\n\n\nCellular\nGap junctions\nElectrical coupling between cells\n\n\nOrgan\nEndocrine signaling\nSystem-wide physiological regulation\n\n\nOrganism\nNeural networks\nSensorimotor coordination\n\n\nSocial\nLanguage/culture\nKnowledge transmission and cooperation\n\n\n\nEach level employs interfaces appropriate to its scale and complexity, enabling collaboration without merging identities. This nested structure prevents paradoxical loops while allowing information and resources to flow across levels.\n\n\n2.4.3 Collaborative Cognition\nCollaborative cognition emerges at multiple scales through interfacial coordination. Consider:\n\nCellular Collectives: Bioelectric signaling coordinates regeneration in planarians, enabling whole-organism problem-solving through cellular collaboration.\nNeural Ensembles: Cortical columns collaborate through synaptic interfaces to recognize patterns no individual neuron could detect.\nSocial Cognition: Cultural practices like scientific methodologies enable collaborative knowledge-building beyond individual capabilities.\n\nThese collaborative systems avoid paradoxical self-reference through interfacial boundaries that restrict information flow while enabling useful coordination. Scientific peer review, for example, prevents circular validation by enforcing separation between authors and reviewers—a social implementation of irreflexivity (\\(\\neg P(x, x)\\)).\n\n\n2.4.4 Technological Scaffolding\nTechnological interfaces extend collaborative capacities across scales. APIs enable software modules to collaborate without exposing internals. Blockchain technologies decentralize financial agency through peer-to-peer interfaces. Yet these technologies also reveal power dynamics: code is law, and its architects wield disproportionate influence (Lessig, 1999).\nCitizen science platforms like Zooniverse let non-experts classify galaxies or track wildlife, bridging layperson and scientist through collaborative interfaces (Lintott et al., 2008). However, algorithmic recommendation systems, while personalizing content, often trap users in ideological echo chambers (Pasquale, 2015). The challenge is designing interfaces that expand horizons rather than constrain them."

The Logic of Belonging\nInterface, Identity & Reality\nDonald Hoffman’s Interface Theory of Perception (ITP) offers a controverse reconceptualization of human perception, arguing that our sensory experiences function less as windows to objective reality and more as species-specific interfaces evolved to maximize fitness. Hoffman employs a powerful computational metaphor (we shall explore through later) to explain his theory. He paints a picture of our perceptions operating like a computer desktop interface, with icons representing complex underlying processes that remain hidden from users. Just as desktop icons hide the file structure in the console of a machine which programers access daily, where both are abstractions into human-readable format of machine code, our perceptions of objects, space, and time hide the true complexity of objective reality while providing actionable affordances.\nThe intersectional space implied here is as rich as the mereological one we covered above. Morevover, they overlad in rather unxecpected fashion. Affordances to relations, signs and identity, perception as means to relate, information to semiotics, and so on. (Need to expand this more eloquently ofc).\nAs Hoffman explains: “According to ITP, space-time as we perceive it is our species-specific desktop, and physical objects as we perceive them are species-specific icons in that desktop”. This framing suggests that perceptual systems evolved not to reveal truth but to guide adaptive behavior. However controversial, we remain neutral in opinions towards the complete thesis and focus on some keen insights that from it are tranferable to interfacing: Interfacing as multi-level set of means allowing nested architectures and scale-free competency development.\nVision—a paradigm of perceptual interfacing—reveals how neural morphology dictates experiential “shape.” The retina’s photoreceptor mosaic (rods and cones) samples light through a hexagonal grid, a morphological solution to packaging efficiency. This grid structure, preserved through multiple synaptic layers, shapes perceived visual fields as topological maps in V1.\nThe counterintuitive core of ITP is captured in Hoffman’s “Fitness Beats Truth” (FBT) theorem, which demonstrates through evolutionary game theory and Monte Carlo simulations that perceptual systems tuned to fitness consistently outcompete those tuned to objective truth. Natural selection, Hoffman argues, “drives true perceptions to swift extinction”.\nThis evolutionary argument directly challenges conventional assumptions that perception reconstructs properties of the objective world. Instead, Hoffman proposes a weaker “Construction Thesis: Perception constructs the properties and categories of an organism’s perceptual world”. This constructed interface helps organisms navigate their environment without requiring access to underlying reality.\nWe’ll explore this proposal given the experimental evidence in developmental and computational bio-chemistry in a later section.\nNotes: 1. As a personal note I would also enjoy to explore a computational simulation at some point, converging my work on Agency and newly proposed developmental arguments on co-evolution, and thermodynamics. Beyond that, 2. I must not forget another thread of exploration which is a policy based tool for inter-agent dynamics assessment. 2. An engaging paragraph on reality is missing and it must exist here to address criticism and provide clarity to the reader.\nA caviat that we will not expand in this review is that Hoffman extends his perceptual framework into a broader theory of consciousness, suggesting that “consciousness creates brain activity, and indeed creates all objects and properties of the physical world”. We do not support this view, and as such thought that it was mention-worthy, yet we do not find it as evidence to dismiss its other arguments. For the effect of clarity, we object to consciousness as fundamental rather than emergent, and other pansychic theories, but remain open to the hypothsis that consciousness and cognition has been subject to evolution leaving breadcrumbs of proto-conscious artifacts, and similarly, intelligence, agency have as well. From this prespective, we do see some ground for interfaces and interfacing means to have been shaped by iteration thus alligning to some degree with the previous section on fitness.\nWhile not subscribing to a consciousness as a fundamental phenomena, efforts in the seminal work on Interface Theory show brave commitment as an attempt to develop a mathematically precise nondualistic approach to derive quantum physics from consciousness rather than vice versa, where we find the non-mutualistic take of relationships intriguing.\nOur binocular vision’s narrow 120° field sacrifices panoramic awareness for stereoscopic depth—a morphological trade-off optimizing primate arboreal navigation (Hoffman, 2019).\nThis seems to suggest that Russell’s paradox warning \\[ R \\in R \\iff R \\not\\in R \\] against unconstrained self-reference, as evidence that Nature avoids such traps through interfacial hierarchies. Self-assembling molecules maintain identity via compartmentalization (lipid membranes) (Autocatalytic sets), preventing infinite reaction loops. Moreover, in the case of Immune systems, antibody paratopes (interface regions) evolve to bind antigens without targeting self—a morphological immune algorithm.\nIn previous work on Agency and Intelligence, we’ve substatially covered Michael Levin’s Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere (TAME) framework. Its insights provide a complementary perspective to both mereology and interface theory by offering an experimentally grounded approach to understanding diverse cognitive systems across scales and substrates, with empirical evidence, data and quite unique and specific case-studies to bring mereological arguments out from purely mathematical or theoretical constructs to actual entities, novel intelligences and their capabilities, the morpho-space where parthood relations are mediated through bioeletricity in regenerative medicine, and even the financial markets where Benjamin Lyons explores prices as cognitive glue. A foundational aspect of TAME is its rejection of binary categorizations of mind and agency. Instead, it proposes a continuous spectrum of cognitive capacities that can be empirically investigated across diverse biological and technological systems. This gradualist approach posits that the question of agency is not philosophical but empirical, to be determined through experimental investigation. As Levin explains, “the correct level of agency with which to treat any system is determined empirically, based on which kind of model affords the most efficient way of prediction and control”. This pragmatic stance echoes Dennett’s Intentional Stance while commited to experimental validation and operability in mediating and understanding consitioning.\nIts insights provide a complementary perspective to both mereology and interface theory by offering an experimentally grounded approach to understanding diverse cognitive systems across scales and substrates, with empirical evidence, data and quite unique and specific case-studies to bring mereological arguments out from purely mathematical or theoretical constructs to actual entities, novel intelligences and their capabilities, the morpho-space where parthood relations are mediated through bioeletricity in regenerative medicine, and even the financial markets where Benjamin Lyons explores prices as cognitive glue.\n\n2.5.1 Ontological Parsimony\nA paramount question in mereology concerns whether accepting mereological principles increases ontological commitments. As Jeroen Smid argues, “if the parts of an object are ‘ontologically innocent’, then sums cannot fail to be innocent either” (Smid, 2017). This perspective challenges the argument that mereology leads to ontological extravagance by creating new entities.\nThe logic of belonging suggests that parts derive identity from their wholes while wholes emerge from their parts—a complementary relationship that avoids redundant ontological commitments. A cell belongs to a tissue in a way that defines both entities: the tissue provides context for the cell’s function, while the cell contributes to the tissue’s capabilities.\nBoundaries as interfaces and identity as relational, reconciling philosophy’s dialectics with mathematics’ rigor. Whether in cells, societies, or algorithms, coherence arises not from isolation but from the disciplined interplay of surface-level interaction.\nIn this light, self-referencing loops are not contradictions but structured redundancies—tools for maintaining stability in a relational universe. The task ahead is to map these interfaces, fro A paramount and critical question in mereology concerns whether accepting mereological principles increases ontological commitments. As Jeroen Smid argues, “if the parts of an object are ‘ontologically innocent’, then sums cannot fail to be innocent either”. This perspective challenges the argument that mereology leads to ontological extravagance by creating new entities. Furthermore, when transcending from man-assembled objects in material-object-relations for example, into member-collection relations of environmental subjects pose a lit revival of the natural accountability debate.\nI hope, that by now, this intersection of mereology and identity, parthood and accountability, sounds not only captivating beyond philosophical complexity but enticing as a potential practical approach into policy, legislation and ethics. As Carrara and Lando note, “The eighteen papers in this special issue scrutinise the multifarious roles that identity plays in mereology”. These intersections reveal mereology’s rich philosophical implications beyond mere formal structure, and we hope to pursue in future work, the wide implication-rage of mereology.\nWe know self-referencing must be avoided, and defining belonging can be done using mereology, category theory allows for composition and identity without contradiction. Going back to the idea of “Something” relating to “Something Other Than Itself”, in both membership and composition, and regardless of levels of abstraction, we may formalise bm the quantum to the cosmic, and embrace the insight that to be is to interact.\nThe Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere (TAME) frames cognition as a scalable phenomenon. In Xenopus embryos, bioelectric patterns encode “target morphology” for regeneration, overriding genetic noise (Pezzulo & Levin, 2016). This process mirrors error-correcting codes in telecom systems, where redundant signals compensate for noise—a mathematical parallel to biological robustness.\nThe synergy between ITP, mereology, and TAME redefines ontological assumptions:\n- ITP: Perceptual categories (e.g., “object”) are fitness-enhancing interfaces, not reality’s ground truth.\n- TAME: Cognitive systems arise from part-whole collaborations, not centralized controllers.\n- Mereology: Wholes derive identity from structured interactions, not intrinsic essence.\nFrom protein binding sites to cortical maps, morphology encodes interaction logic through geometric precision. These interfacial “rules of engagement” resolve paradoxes—whether thermodynamic limits in lungs or self/non-self discrimination in immunity—by structuring relationships across scales. The interplay of form and function reveals a deeper truth: reality is shaped by interfaces, the syntax through which parts compose wholes without contradiction.\n\n\n2.5.2 Social Belonging\nSocial belonging operates through similar mereological principles. Durkheim’s collective effervescence—the shared energy of religious rituals—acts as a social interface, binding individuals to groups while excluding outsiders (Durkheim, 1912). Yet exclusion carries a cost: marginalized communities often develop subjugated knowledges (Foucault, 1980), alternative interfaces that reject assimilation.\nVictor Turner’s concept of liminality identifies transitional phases (e.g., rites of passage) as temporary interface dismantlings, allowing transitions between roles (child → adult, outsider → member). These cultural interfaces regulate belonging while preventing paradoxical identity loops.\n\n\n2.5.3 Implications\nThe “natural accountability debate” mentioned in your notes highlights how belonging carries ethical dimensions, particularly when considering environmental systems. How responsibility distributes across mereological hierarchies remains a crucial question for policy, legislation, and ethics.\nMereological principles can inform governance structures that avoid self-referential contradictions. For instance, regulatory frameworks could model stakeholders as objects and legislation as morphisms, ensuring composable, non-contradictory laws. The principle of proper parthood (\\[ P(x, y) \\to \\neg P(y, x) \\]) translates to governance as the separation of powers—no entity should regulate itself without proper interfaces and boundaries.\nIf reality is co-constituted through relational boundaries, then responsibility lies in how we design these boundaries. Ethical interfaces should:\n\nResist self-referential tyranny: Avoid closed loops (e.g., social media addiction).\nPrioritize adaptability: Allow user customization and contestation.\nDemocratize access: Ensure marginalized communities co-design the systems affecting them.\n\nThese principles apply across domains:\n\nAI Ethics: Neural networks trained on biased data internalize toxic interfaces, mistaking correlation for causality. Mitigation requires explicit interfacial guardrails (e.g., fairness constraints).\nBioengineering: Levin’s bioelectric interfaces suggest a future where tissues self-assemble ethically, guided by voltage gradients rather than centralized control.\nSocial Media: Platforms can design interfaces that foster dialogue rather than polarization, incorporating circuit-breakers that prevent algorithmic amplification of harmful content.\n\n\n\n2.5.4 Interfaces as Political Structures\nInterfaces are inherently political. A door handle, ostensibly neutral, excludes wheelchair users if designed without affordances for pushing (Norman, 1988). Similarly, facial recognition technologies, trained on biased datasets, disproportionately misidentify marginalized groups (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018). Interfaces embody the values of their creators, amplifying some voices while muting others.\nLanguage, our oldest interface, mediates access to knowledge and connection. Wittgenstein argued that “the limits of my language mean the limits of my world” (Wittgenstein, 1922). Yet translation tools and augmented communication devices are expanding these limits, enabling cross-cultural dialogue. Conversely, “digital divides” exclude billions from the interfaces defining modern life—a stark reminder that access is power.\nHinting at an ethics of interfaces. If reality is co-constituted through relational boundaries, then responsibility lies in how we design these boundaries:\nInterfaces transform experience by redistributing agency. Consider bioelectricity: cells communicate via ion gradients, forming morphogenetic interfaces that guide tissue development (Levin, 2021). These interfaces enable collective intelligence, allowing cells to solve problems (e.g., regenerating limbs) no single cell could manage. Similarly, blockchain technologies decentralize financial agency, replacing banks with peer-to-peer interfaces. Yet power persists: code is law, and its architects wield disproportionate influence (Lessig, 1999).\nInterfaces can democratize access. Citizen science platforms like Zooniverse let non-experts classify galaxies or track wildlife, bridging layperson and scientist (Lintott et al., 2008). However, empowerment requires vigilance. Algorithmic recommendation systems, while personalizing content, often trap users in ideological echo chambers (Pasquale, 2015). The challenge is designing interfaces that expand horizons rather than constrain them.\nNeutrality or Complicity? Question 4: Are interfaces neutral? No—interfaces are political. A door handle, ostensibly neutral, excludes wheelchair users if designed without affordances for pushing (Norman, 1988). Similarly, facial recognition technologies, trained on biased datasets, disproportionately misidentify marginalized groups (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018). Interfaces embody the values of their creators, amplifying some voices while muting others.\nLanguage, our oldest interface, mediates access to knowledge and connection. Wittgenstein argued that “the limits of my language mean the limits of my world” (Wittgenstein, 1922). Yet translation tools and augmented communication devices (e.g., AAC) are expanding these limits, enabling cross-cultural dialogue. Conversely, “digital divides” exclude billions from the interfaces defining modern life—a stark reminder that access is power."

    "text": "2.6 Conclusion: The Paradoxical Truth of Boundaries\nYour conclusion beautifully captures the core insight: “To coexist, entities must first delineate where they end and others begin.” Strengthen this by emphasizing the paradoxical truth that boundaries enable connection rather than prevent it.\nRecapitulate how interfaces—from quantum fields to social norms—resolve paradoxes by structuring interaction, enabling coherent emergence across scales. Close with the profound implication: reality itself speaks the language of interfaces.\nRussell’s paradox taught us that coherence requires constraints. As we design tomorrow’s interfaces—brain-machine hybrids, quantum algorithms, climate models—we must embrace this lesson. Ethical interfaces should:\nResist self-referential tyranny: Avoid closed loops (e.g., social media addiction).\nPrioritize adaptability: Allow user customization and contestation.\nDemocratize access: Ensure marginalized communities co-design the systems affecting them.\nInterfaces are not just tools; they are the scaffolding of reality. To build them wisely is to shape a world where connection does not demand conformity, and boundaries liberate rather than confine.\nThe deepest lesson of interfacial thinking is that isolation is an illusion. Nothing exists except through interaction—but interaction demands structure. From quantum fields to social norms, interfaces are the rules of engagement, the protocols that allow difference to coexist.\nCollectively they suggest that interfacing represents a process connecting parts to wholes, organisms to environments, and cognitive systems to their components and targets.The ontological and epistemological implications of these frameworks extend beyond theoretical interest. They inform practical approaches to fields ranging from artificial intelligence and synthetic biology to regenerative medicine and cognitive science. By understanding interfaces as adaptive, evolved systems that mediate between domains rather than transparent windows to reality, we gain new insights into both natural and engineered systems. Future research should focus on empirical validation of these theoretical intersections, particularly through experimental investigations of how part-whole relationships manifest in perceptual and cognitive systems. Such research may reveal new principles of interfacing applicable across natural and artificial systems, further bridging the conceptual boundaries between these complementary frameworks.\nIn a world fractured by polarization, climate crises, and algorithmic alienation, the task is not to eliminate boundaries but to redesign them. To build interfaces that are permeable yet firm, directional yet adaptable. Russell’s paradox began as a mathematical curiosity; it ends as a manifesto for relational humility. To interface is to acknowledge that we are all parts of a whole—and that the whole depends on how we connect.\nhttps://www.eastcoastoralsurgery.com.au/about/ https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/4972276.pdf https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3241/paper22.pdf https://sites.socsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff/interface.pdf https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8770jyz6vvo https://portal.research.lu.se/files/3462956/5148698.pdf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mereology https://scienceandnonduality.com/videos/donald-hoffman-consciousness-and-the-interface-theory-of-perception/ https://news.sky.com/story/michael-mosley-race-against-time-in-search-for-tv-doctor-as-rescuers-shift-focus-to-mountainous-path-13149438 https://reviews.ophen.org/2018/11/16/giorgio-lando-mereology-a-philosophical-introduction-review/ https://philarchive.org/archive/CARMAI-8 https://eupercebo.unb.br/2021/06/22/evidencias-da-percepcao-enquanto-uma-interface-a-proposta-computacional-de-donald-hoffman/ https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10346 https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2050/FOUST_paper_8.pdf https://davidadger.org/2023/09/19/mereological-syntax/ https://sites.socsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff/Hoffman-Stevens-Handbook.pdf https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8988303/ https://www.reddit.com/r/consciousness/comments/1ae1254/explain_donald_hoffman_theory/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTIY3Z00XMM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmKNtH5J01A https://thoughtforms.life/books-forthcoming/ https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/celebrity-deaths/tragic-dr-michael-mosley-left-huge-sum-to-beloved-wife-after-he-died-on-holiday-in-greece/news-story/83d0c469b71557ffa1bfc8d33711326a https://au.news.yahoo.com/michael-mosley-latest-search-underway-121413058.html https://www.mdpi.com/2409-9287/5/3/16 https://www.academia.edu/34943705/HANDBOOK_OF_MEREOLOGY_academia https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mereology/ https://champollion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/champollion_esslli2012.pdf https://multisenserealism.com/2014/01/14/consciousness-and-the-interface-theory-of-perception-donald-hoffman/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26384988/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5Hz1giUUT8 Buolamwini, J., & Gebru, T.

    "text": "Notes on Intelligence for the ‘AI’ Era\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe aim is to draft an informal overview of recent developments in research efforts tied to intelligence, paralleled with the undergoing and pivotal social, techno and ecological shift in the artificial intelligence age. Standing at the cusp of a new era for disciplines, the internet, knowledge, and humans, it seems pertinent to examine the convergence of various takes on intelligence - from computer science to biology, neuroscience, philosophy, and even cybernetics - so that knowingly we may shape the tools of today into the world and systems of tomorrow. This is a open note, and a work in progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Introduction\n\n“What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.” - Aristotle\n\nWe begin with some apropos foundational concepts, and distinctions relating to intelligence. As per convention, we first must propose a working definition for it. What is intelligence? There are many proposals (Legg and Hutter 2007) and a few certainties, thus, it is truly important to recognize that as for now, we do not have a single definition for it. While intelligent individuals may simply smile if prompted with the such question, it is nonetheless relevant the attempt to have a functional, and empirically tractable answer to it, one suiting the necessary perspective when addressing across domains. In practice, having a working definition of intelligence means exercising the bridge that connects theory to observations and from biological to engineered scopes one that allows us to make predictions towards potentially more effective relational strategies, and closer to the bottom of its meaning.\n\nChalmers, David J. 1996. “Facing up to the Problem of Consciousness.” Https://Consc.net/Papers/Facing.pdf.\nSomething may be perceived as intelligent, but is the awareness of such intelligence by said thing a determinant of it? The arguable ambiguity between intelligence and self-awareness point to open questions in our understanding of cognition and even the hard problem of consciousness(Chalmers 1996).\nThe difficulty in defining intelligence is not merely a semantic one, as it reflects this concept’s multidimensional nature. When asked to define intelligence, two dozen prominent theorists provided two dozen somewhat different definitions(Neisser 1996), which isn’t in itself a failure in defining it, neither it is a matter deemed to be forever open to interpretation. Rather, it seems to be evidence that no matter how lightly we may use the term intelligence namely in artificial intelligence, we do it, even if not fully aware or its meaning, or in agreement of what it means. The are several semantic cases of this nature, and it does not impede conveying the idea of intelligence or any idea intelligently.\nThe misconception of intelligence referring to human-only or human-like abilities such as self-awareness or reason is intriguingly informative of a deeper insight of the relationship a thing has to itself, it’s identity, to what differs from it.\nWhen intelligence is broadly conceptualized as the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills(Neisser 1996), there’s an implicit extension to adapt effectively to the environment, and learn from experience. Here said entity must have some sort of embodiment, one that allows for a dual relationship with it’s internal states and external events. In computational contexts, intelligence is then related to goal-directed behavior(Duncan et al. 1996), where something acts so as to maximize performance towards a goal or task, which is based on past experience. Conversely, conventional methods to access intelligence coefficients in Humans, regardless of arguments in their efficiency, contradict the premise (Ree and Earles 1998), as higher scores have not been found to translate systematically in job performance (Steel and Fariborzi 2024). Yet, as an information processing capability, a useful working and general definition may be intelligence as the competency to achieve goals / solve problems in a given space [Legg and Hutter (2007)](Michael Levin 2021)[^1]. [^1]: I should expand this at some point to include material, formal, ideal, structural and post structural debates\n\nNeisser, Gwyneth; Bouchard, Ulrich; Boodoo. 1996. “Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns.” American Psychological Association 51 (2): 77–101. https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.51.2.77.\n\nDuncan, J., H. Emslie, P. Williams, R. Johnson, and C. Freer. 1996. “Intelligence and the Frontal Lobe: The Organization of Goal-Directed Behavior.” Cognitive Psychology 30 (3): 257–303.\n\nRee, Malcolm James, and James A. Earles. 1998. “Intelligence Is the Best Predictor of Job Performance.” Personnel Psychology 1 (3): 431–42. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-6570.1998.tb00770.x.\n\nSteel, Piers, and Hadi Fariborzi. 2024. “A Longitudinal Meta-Analysis of Range Restriction Estimates and General Mental Ability Validity Coefficients: Better Addressing Overcorrection Amid Decline Effects.” Intelligence 88: 101703.\n\nLegg, Shane, and Marcus Hutter. 2007. “A Collection of Definitions of Intelligence.” arXiv Preprint arXiv:0706.3639.\n\nLevin, Michael. 2021. “Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere (TAME): An Experimentally-Grounded Framework for Understanding Diverse Bodies and Minds.” Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience 15: 709301.\nThis perspective allows us to recognize various forms of intelligence across species and systems. An interdisciplinary approach seems relevant here precisely because while single discipline may offer many perspectives, across disciplines the fragmentation and ambiguity hinder any chance of consensus.While the study of intelligence across humans, animals, and artificial systems reveals similarities and profound differences, looking at intelligence as a competency spectrum with expression in multi-dimensional spaces, places the ability to acquire, process, and apply information to achieve goals, adapt to environments, and problem-solving as mere manifestations of said expression. Here, we understand spaces as including physical, transcriptional, anatomical, physiological, and other abstract domains, combining Legg and Hutter’s (Legg and Hutter 2007) survey of intelligence definitions with Michael Levin’s developmental and biological perspective (Michael Levin 2021).\nIn regards to competency expression, we may be still tied to the limitations our own competencies allow us to observe, however it also offers the possibility through this framing to develop new means to expand our competencies, the same way we’ve developed tools to see beyond the spectrum of visible light. In this context, the hypothesis of an interdisciplinary and meta-entity Turing test could assess intelligence through a lens that transcends anthropomorphic mimicry. Traditional Turing tests focus on linguistic deception: “Can a machine imitate human conversation?” Yet this approach, while historically pivotal, needs some adjustments to address a competency-based intelligence understanding. A meta-entity Turing test would instead evaluate how systems recognize and interact with intelligence across domains, and allow competency mapping of problem-solving in physical, transcriptional, or abstract spaces (e.g., optimizing metabolic pathways, or negotiating ethical dilemmas). When slime molds exhibit problem-solving competency through gradient navigation and resource optimization(Reid et al. 2012), and systems like [[AlphaFold demonstrate competency in protein-folding spaces(Jumper et al. 2024)previously considered exclusive to evolutionary processes challenging traditional notions of problem-solving and adaptability in temporal scales(Michael Levin and Martyniuk 2024), while the later have been said “aware but not conscious”(Wang 2023), where does the first one stand?\n\nReid, C. R., T. Latty, A. Dussutour, and M. Beekman. 2012. “Slime Mold Uses Externalized Spatial ‘Memory’ to Navigate in Complex Environments.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 109 (43): 17490–94. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1215037109.\n\nJumper, John M. et al. 2024. “Accurate Structure Prediction of Biomolecular Interactions with AlphaFold 3.” Nature 614 (7949): 1–12. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-01425-0.\n\n———. 2024. “The Bioelectric Code: An Ancient Computational Medium for Dynamic Control of Growth and Form.” BioSystems 164: 76–93. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystems.2017.08.009.\n\nWang, Jinchang. 2023. “Self-Awareness, a Singularity of AI.” Philosophy Study 13 (2): 68–77. https://doi.org/10.17265/2159-5313/2023.02.003.\n\nWalsh, Toby. 2022. “The Meta-Turing Test.” arXiv:2205.05268.\nIs said that conventional Turing tests have a design flaw of asymmetry, and the Meta-Turing test (Walsh 2022) resolves this asymmetry by a peer grading approach where both entities, the tester, and the testee are accessed mutually through interaction, evaluating abilities to identify and critique flawed problem-solving approaches. This of course is useful in a conversational human-machine setting, but we could take the premise further to assess intelligence profiles across competency spaces.\nHere, we’d faced with obvious challenges of intelligibility between entities, and moreover levels on competency withing entity configuration.\nAlthough, if we keep the asymmetry, we overcome the intelligibility issue but we remain lacking the tools to correctly identify competencies in multi-scale embodiments, and temporal scales. From energy allocation “decisions” to dynamic reallocation of resources, outside a conversational scenario we re-think if we do have the means to assess how intelligent are the current AI systems actually are.\nThe meta-Turing test reintroduces the Chinese Room argument with a new perspective: “Could a system that explains its symbol manipulation processes (meta-cognition) cross the understanding threshold?”, and while the early experiments with large language models (LLMs) some degree of self-reflection capabilities was posit, these capabilities and the premise of the meta-Turinng test remain rooted in pattern recognition rather than experiential understanding, and rely on our ability to comprehend their explanations and identify underlying patterns.\nIt would be a considerable improvement to find a entity-agnostic method perhaps even to so focussed on testing but in identifying or translating competencies from the testee to the tester and vice versa.\nSo, how intelligent is the AI of today?\nWhile Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are often conflated, their meaning differs. AI is a broad concept, encompassing systems designed to solve problems or perform tasks and can use rule-based, or learning-based models in their components. Machine Learning (ML), by definition, expresses the engineered intent to learn by design. Not all Artificial Intelligence systems are designed to learn after training, thus Machine Learning could be seen as a subset of AI, aiming for systems that improve throughout exposure. Almost as if AI was the pursuit of creating “minds”, while ML is about creating “learning devices”.\nProposed by Joshua Bach in his 2007 thesis “Principles of Synthetic Intelligence PSI: An Architecture of Motivated Cognition” building on Dietrich Dörner’s Psi theory, it offers a comprehensive and philosophically grounded approach towards the creation of true intelligence, while at the same time attempting to understand it. Touching on enactive theories of agency(De Jesus 2018), where intelligence, autonomy, behaviour, purpose, and teleology(Rosenblueth, Wiener, and Bigelow 1943), suggests that embodiment, composition, and a variety of features would then allow for systemic preconditions for learning and perceiving, having goals, motivations, and the ability to navigate complex, uncertain environments.\n\nDe Jesus, P. 2018. “Thinking Through Enactive Agency: Sense-Making, Bio-Semiosis and the Ontologies of Organismic Worlds.” Phenomenology and Cognitive Sciences 17: 861–87. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11097-018-9562-2.\n\nRosenblueth, Arturo, Norbert Wiener, and Julian Bigelow. 1943. “Behavior, Purpose and Teleology.” Philosophy of Science 10 (1): 18–24. https://doi.org/10.1086/286788.\n\n———. 2021. “Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere: An Experimentally-Grounded Framework for Understanding Diverse Bodies and Minds.” Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience 15: 732372.\nWhen combining computational and biological views, a technological approach to mind everywhere, TAME (M. Levin 2021), gives us experimental evidence of a truly diverse spectrum of intelligent entities, and through which experimental means of interaction in spaces that are not our own.\nDrawing from evolutionary of biology, and the challenges faced by early life forms in surviving and adapting to their environments may actually be quite significant when aiming for truly adaptive AI (M. Levin, Pezzulo, and Finkelstein 2017) (Baluška and Levin 2016)\n\nLevin, M., G. Pezzulo, and J. M. Finkelstein. 2017. “Novosphingobium Sp. PP1Y as a Model for Studying Adaptive Decisions.” Frontiers in Microbiology 8: 2571.\n\nBaluška, F., and M. Levin. 2016. “On Having No Head: Cognition Throughout Biological Systems.” Frontiers in Psychology 7: 902.\n\nBach, J. 2009. Principles of Synthetic Intelligence PSI: An Architecture of Motivated Cognition. Oxford University Press.\n\nLevin, M. 2019. “The Computational Boundary of a \"Self\": Developmental Bioelectricity Drives Multicellularity and Scale-Free Cognition.” Frontiers in Psychology 10: 2688.\nMoreover, the views of embodied motivated cognition (Bach 2009), and the computational boundaries of a “self” (M. Levin 2019), also seem to suggest that architectures may vary, which challenges the static notions of intelligence as a property, into a process subject to interference, and where internal and external states interplay creating diminishing or augmented competency-state chains.\nAs such, and in a reduced form, “intelligence seems less connected to correct outputs in an abstract setting and more deeply intertwined interaction-based products of things and their environment.”\nSeeing intelligence as a process also allows for a substrate-independence view of what constitutes a mind, meaning that a mind could be the physical mapping of said process in a configuration space, instead of a brain or any embodied part. Associated with a mind are often mental representations and memories, and so is “self-reflection”, and it has been an accepted convention the the mind - body distinction. This notion is challenged (not to say outdated) when the memory of previously faced challenges persisted through complete brain regeneration of planarian flatworms (Shomrat and Levin 2013). As for the mapping of the process of intelligence in anatomical space, the above suggests that a mind would fit better a description of a network contributing to a form of body-wide information system(Michael Levin and Martyniuk 2018).\n\nShomrat, Tal, and Michael Levin. 2013. “An Automated Training Paradigm Reveals Long-Term Memory in Planarians and Its Persistence Through Head Regeneration.” The Journal of Experimental Biology 216 (20): 3799–3810. https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.087809.\n\nLevin, Michael, and Christopher J.

Upholding mereological explorations, from mereology the study of parts and wholes, and the mathematics of structured relationships, category theory, this article formalises interfaces as non-self-referential connectors that enforce logical consistency. We demonstrate how interfaces dissolve Russell-like contradictions, clarify abstraction layers in biological and computational systems, and provide a framework for modeling interaction through geometric and algebraic constraints. \n\n\n\n\n\nJun 20, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Relational Universe: Measuring What Connects Us, Avant-Propos\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the core of my research I noticed it to be set upon a simple question: Why do things interact?

When membrane potential oscillations maintaxin phase coherence (ΔΦ ≈ 0°), they reinforce anatomical memory patterns. Conversely, when out of phase (ΔΦ ≈ 180°), they disrupt normal patterning.\n\n\nConstructive vs. Destructive Bioelectric Interference\n\nAs illustrated above, constructive interference creates coherent, directional bioelectric flux (blue vectors), whereas destructive interference produces chaotic, opposing vector fields (red vectors). This aligns with our prediction that phase-locked regeneration processes would be accelerated by constructive interference and disrupted by destructive interference."

    "text": "1.1 Embodied Models for Realistic Movement & Robots That Dream\nThe potential for achieving extreme realism in moving images will likely require models to be embodied, at least at some stage of training. Recent work on motion capture and transposition, such as ByteDance’s Magic Avatar, demonstrates the ability to generate synthetic AI video with transposed actors and environments (ByteDance, 2023). Coupled with advancements in 3D environment reconstruction, like NVIDIA’s Neuralangelo could contribute to more realistic movement generation(Xiangli et al. 2023), We think we may be on the cusp of some really exciting breakthroughs in generating realistic motion and interactions.\n\nXiangli, Y., L. Xu, X. Pan, N. Zhao, A. Rao, C. Theobalt, B. Dai, and D. Lin. 2023. “Neuralangelo: High-Fidelity Neural Surface Reconstruction.”\nEmbodiment can mean many things and have as well many interpretations. The core idea is for the software to be bound to a container, and this container be intrinsically related to the software, where the feedback mechanisms, we discussed above, loop between one adn the other passing information of internal states and the surroundings. New sensing mechanisms and protocol design must then be developed, improves and optimized.\nAs we look towards the future of AI and ML, particularly in the realm of image generation and embodied intelligence, we find ourselves at the cusp of a paradigm shift. The mortal computation thesis, coupled with advancements in cross-modal hashing, error correction, and biomimetic approaches, presents exciting possibilities for more efficient, adaptable, and biologically-inspired AI systems.\nThe integration of concepts like the Free Energy Principle and circular causality from cybernetics into AI architectures could lead to significant breakthroughs in how machines process information and interact with their environment. Potentially resulting in AI systems that are not only more powerful but also more aligned with biological substrates."

    "text": "1.2 Food For Though (And Discussions)\nReflect on these developments, a key observation lays on how rapidly technology is and will likely keep evolving. There’s no shortage of fascinating areas to explore, and the scenarios we will shortly live and whiteness are completely unforeseen. Some questions that seem worth thinking about are for example “What is the potential for high photorealism and personalization in avatars to lead to stronger embodiment and self-identification in virtual environments of Humans, and how will that impact the way we relate to each other and our non-virtual environment?”, and “How will societies evolver, adapt and integrate their cultural identities, having these new domains of interaction at the peer-relations level, and new means of individual self-expression?”. Moreover, we may ask: “What kind of new necessities will rise?”, “How will this new environment shape future generations into a new stage of Human Evolution?”, and “What kind of safe guards we can design for ourselves, to ensure that what we hold as valuable now, will persist in the future?”\nFor any kind of new system we create, given the shared meta-substrate: a closed planetary system called Earth, it seems quite reasonable in design principles that align shared constraints and necessities.\nAdditionally, intuition tells me that when striving for literacy at all levels of society and the continuous encouragement by facilitating the access to information and knowledge, is paramount. The reverse is a then the choice of alienating some, and deliberately incapacitating democracies, thus impacting policy-making, governance and constituting an obstruction to constructive debates and participatory politics.\nMoreover, as science and information become more complex, more specialized, a similar effort in bridging topics, simplifying language and streamlining the learning curve towards a panoramic understanding of the current knowledge map, seems, again, a sensible and tangible course of action towards current and future assurance of sense-making.\nIn conclusion, while it’s not easy to predict exactly where these developments will lead us, or if they will happen at all, neither vehemently subscribe to any idea in particular, thinking about the present and envisioning the future scope of possibilities helps us design the tomorrow we want to live in. In such, this series of opinion articles aim just that, informally and accessibly, to the best of my abilities, expose some ideas, transversely and across fields of inquiry. The future of AI and ML is not just about technological advancement, but about re-imagining the very nature of intelligence, computation, ecosystems, societies and life. As researchers, developers, and citizens, we have a responsibility to shape this future thoughtfully and responsibly.\n\n1.2.1 References"

    "text": "Preface\n\n“This most of all: ask yourself in the most silent hour of your night: must I write? Dig into yourself for a deep answer. And if this answer rings out in assent, if you meet this solemn question with a strong, simple -I must-, then build your life in accordance with this necessity; your whole life, even into its humblest and most indifferent hour, must become a sign and witness to this impulse.” Reiner Maria Rilke\n\nWhen embarking on this project, I found myself drawn to the question “What is agency?”, one which has fascinated many great thinkers across centuries and cultures. This question of agency as a polysemic term relates to action, interaction, causality, intention, and the organisation of systems ranging from cells to societies. My goal, initially, was to explore agency through various lenses, and look for binding principles across scales. As I developed some understanding, it struck me, not only were there points of convergence in how different disciplines understood agency as agency itself connected these disparate fields of study.\nCognate to how Aristotle’s concept of the “efficient cause”, the agent or process that brings about change had a surprising resonance with D’Arcy Thompson’s work. In Thompson’s view, physical forces like gravity, surface tension, and pressure act as efficient causes, shaping the forms of living organisms. While Aristotle might have attributed these forms to a more teleological purpose, Thompson showed how physical laws could drive the development of complex structures, and these could be beautifully expressed through mathematics. Thompson’s exploration of forces acting on biological forms as identifying the physical efficient causes that structure life, seems quite relevant because in more modern terms we can consider physical forces as fundamental interactions. The study of the emergence of life tries to bridge with an understanding of how from those interactions complex life can emerge and self-organize.\nThat connection between efficient causes and the forces shaping the world felt/feel deeply significant, and continues to be relevant when delving into how forces that shape nature translate into self-organization. Observations related to order, scales and organisation are in turn connected to open questions of the origin of life, morphogenesis, and other forms of “becoming” of the world and into the world. Once “here”, things interact, predictions are made upon behaviors that seem determined by their nature and the laws that govern “everything”. Modern questions of causal theories and fundamental physics ask: How do interactions between fundamental particles lead to the emergence of complex structures and behaviors? What role does information play in shaping these processes? How can we understand causality at different levels of organization, from the quantum realm to the macroscopic world?\nThe relevance that these perspectives have in today’s research and governance practices was a compelling drive for this huge endeavor (I voluntarily) signed up for. After all, there is a dissonance in the apparent laws that govern things and the laws that Human societies use to organise and collaborate. Could deeper insights or even interpretations of the first help us address some of the challenges the second face?\nThere are many parallels and analogies drawn from physics to other fields of inquiry. There are also several reasonable arguments for the dissonance between the laws we call natural, and the ones we make. Put simply, they are different things, but are they? While the mystery of life and existence remains as is, living and non-living systems are composed of nested levels of organization, and while the fundamental level of reality is still in question, without a doubt the policies we make affect the reality we perceive, individually and collectively. Not just ours, but of all entities embedded in our environment, which some are so small we forget they too are embedded entities in their own environments. Environments which are made up of things that we change, build upon and draw from.\nAcross these hierarchies of how things become things by organised clumps of matter, observations tell us that from the very simple to the increasingly complex things interact, and from unorganised to orderly, and to decay things across scales exhibit “inter-active” properties. From light that bends to a gesture of affection, to forms of communication to how information flows, to homeostatic cycles, babies, trees, and seasons.\nThese influences, diverse as they are, coalesced into a hypothesis that agency was far more widespread and adaptable than I had ever imagined: regardless of any degrees of intelligence, composition or origin, what dictates relationships could shape a new understanding for relating.\nCould agency and interaction be part of something hidden in plain sight?\nOur senses may not tell us entirely what reality is, but from interdisciplinary experimental evidence to theoretical foundations, we can explore how agency and interaction relate. In pursuit of an explanation for why things interact, implies the assumption that some form of enabling devices for the such could be recognisable, allowing connections, which if true, their understanding could improve our knowledge of design principles for thriving across scales.\nThis required a shift in perspective, one that takes hyper-specialised notions within these scales to across them, and instead of getting bogged down in arguments on how they may differ, we should instead look towards all the notions and see if they ”dance”.\nOn a practical note, this study touches responsibility: We live on a planet with finite resources, a closed system. This reality demands that we think carefully about how we organize ourselves, how we design our cities, and how we develop new technologies.\nIt’s no longer enough to ask, “Does this work?”, instead we can ask, “Does this contribute to the long-term thriving of the whole system?”. It requires recognising that not all systems are necessarily optimized for some goal, and that it may be hard for us to even recognise goals in settings different from our own, but opening up to the possibility that we may be dismissing popular ideas on the interconnectedness of all things, and that is our ignorance preventing us from working towards some kind of harmony.\nThis relational perspective on agency has the potential to shift our understanding and practices to a truly integrated one supporting the natural world, and us in it.\nI see this book as a starting point for conversations that reach across disciplines, where philosophers, scientists, artists, policymakers, and citizens come together to explore the meaning of agency.\nUnder the assumption that everything impacts everything else, what if we could allow man-made systems to be aware of it? Whether those systems are cities, technologies, or policies, we might be ensuring that their next generations, artificial or otherwise, are by design built for co-evolution.\nWhile this has not always been the case, and the universe seems to be old, dangerous and weird, it also seems that systems that work together, become more than some of their parts, they persist, giving novel phenomena a chance to be.\nWhile the assumptions can be objectionable, I would like to use the gift of my brief life and the available means to explore this. As many came before me, and could not continue their work, as I hope when I’m no longer, some will also care for relationships, and be in absolute awe of the beauty our senses allows, moved by pain and curiosity, and held together by immense levels of collaboration, cooperation and remains open to the possibility that the awareness of it may have a scientific explanation.\nAs such, this book represents two years of exploration a journey through approximately 500 articles spanning philosophy, biology, artificial intelligence, sociology, and more. It has been both daunting and transformative. Along the way, I’ve come to appreciate not only the richness of the existing body of knowledge but also the gaps that remain between its parts.\nAs you read through these pages, I invite you to join me with an open mind, to explore new possibilities for understanding agency.\nTogether, we might uncover insights that not only deepen our knowledge but also help us build better relationships with one another, with our environments, and with the systems we create."

    "text": "The concept of an interface as a structured boundary mediating interactions between entities, seems relevant as an idea resolving self-referential paradoxes and generalizing compositional hierarchies across inquiry domains. By redefining boundaries as structured interfaces, this work resolves self-referential paradoxes and unifies compositional hierarchies across scales.\n\n\n\nSynthesizing insights from mereology (the study of parts and wholes) (Leśniewski), category theory (the mathematics of structured relationships) (Mac Lane), and boundary metaphysics (Brentano-Chisholm), this article formalizes interfaces as non-self-referential connectors that enforce logical consistency while enabling complex systems to evolve. We formalize interfaces as non-conflating connectors that enforce logical consistency while enabling emergent complexity. We demonstrate how interfaces resolve Russell-like contradictions, clarify abstraction layers in biology and computer science, and provide a universal framework for modeling interaction without ambiguity, and sase studies span biological membranes, CPU registers, urban BLTs, and quantum decoherence, demonstrating how interfaces mediate existence by delineating entities without self-reference. This framework shifts scientific inquiry from substance-centric to relationship-first paradigms.\nThe increasing complexity of systems-biological, digital, and social-demands a unifying framework to resolve contradictions arising from self-reference and conflation. This paper proposes structured interfaces as non-conflating relational primitives that delineate boundaries while enabling interaction. By synthesizing mereology, category theory, and paradox resolution, we argue that interfaces are constitutive of reality itself, resolving Russell’s paradox and unifying compositional hierarchies across domains.\nSelf-referential paradoxes, such as Russell’s paradox, reveal a fundamental tension in systems where entities define or reference themselves. Russell’s 1901 demonstration that the set \\[ R = \\{x \\mid x \\not\\in x\\} \\] leads to the contradiction \\[ R \\in R \\iff R \\not\\in R \\] forced mathematicians to confront the dangers of unrestricted self-containment. This crisis birthed axiomatic set theory but left broader questions unresolved: Is it possible to formalize how do entities interact without collapsing into contradiction?\nAs such interfaces as formal boundaries governing interactions, solve this problem by separating entities into distinct domains. Interfaces are not merely physical or conceptual divides but relational structures that:\n1. Prohibit self-referential loops.\n2. Define directional interactions (e.g., inputs/outputs).\n3. Preserve identity across compositional hierarchies.\nHowever, this self-referential set membership (\\(R = \\{ x \\mid x \\notin x \\}\\)), is not fully resolved through axiomatic constraints (e.g., ZF regularity), yet through interface-mediated delineation we constructively unearth a physically rooted possibility. By partitioning the universe into disjoint sets via boundaries, interfaces enforce irreflexivity, prohibiting entities from containing themselves. As examples to illustrate the idea:\n\nNatural Boundaries: Cell membranes separate intracellular components from extracellular matrices, preventing metabolic self-conflation [^@smith2024bio].\nDigital Boundaries: The empty set \\(\\varnothing\\) acts as a boundary marker in encryption, where keys mediate access to bitstrings without self-reference [^@lee2023crypto].\n\nThis structural approach aligns with mereological disjointness (\\(\\forall x, y \\in S, x \\not\\subseteq y\\)) and categorical directionality (morphisms \\(f: A \\to B\\) prohibit \\(f: A \\to A\\)). Interfaces thus dissolve paradoxes by constraining interaction, not by fiat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly set theory assumed the unrestricted comprehension principle, allowing any definable collection to form a set. Russell’s paradox exposed this as untenable, necessitating axioms like:\n- Axiom of Specification (ZF set theory): \\[ \\forall A \\exists B \\forall x (x \\in B \\iff x \\in A \\land P(x)) \\], restricting sets to subsets of existing sets.\n- Axiom of Regularity: \\[ \\forall S (\\exists x \\in S \\implies \\exists y \\in S \\land y \\cap S = \\emptyset) \\], preventing sets from belonging to themselves.\nThese axioms eliminated self-reference but did not address how entities interact across abstraction layers.\n\n\n\n\nMereology: Stanisław Leśniewski’s framework for part-whole relationships formalized belonging without sets, using predicates like \\[ P(x, y) \\] (“x is a part of y”) governed by axioms (e.g., transitivity, irreflexivity).\n\nCategory Theory: Saunders Mac Lane’s algebraic structures (objects, morphisms) modeled relationships between entities, prioritizing compositionality over internal structure.\n\nBoth frameworks avoided paradoxes but lacked a unified theory of interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn mereology, an interface is the sum of interactions between a part and its complement. For a part \\(x\\) of a whole \\(y\\), the interface \\(I(x, y)\\) is defined by:\n\nSeparation: \\(x \\cap (y \\setminus x) = \\emptyset\\) (no overlap).\nInteraction Set: \\(I(x, y) = \\{ f \\mid f: x \\to y \\setminus x \\}\\), where \\(f\\) represents exchanges (e.g., signals, energy).\n\nTheorem 1 (Non-Self-Containment):\nIf \\(P(x, y)\\) (x is a part of y), then \\(\\neg \\exists f: y \\to x\\) (no morphism from whole to part).\nProof: Follows from mereological irreflexivity (\\(\\neg P(x, x)\\)).\n\n\n\nIn category theory, interfaces are morphisms between objects. Let Sys be a category where:\n- Objects: Entities (e.g., cells, software modules).\n- Morphisms: Interfaces (e.g., biochemical pathways, API calls).\nComposition Rule: For morphisms \\(f: A \\rightarrow B\\) and \\(g: B \\rightarrow C\\), \\(g \\circ f: A \\rightarrow C\\) must hold.\nExample:\n- Let \\(\\text{Cell}\\) and \\(\\text{Blood}\\) be objects.\n- The morphism \\(\\text{Osmosis}: \\text{Cell} \\rightarrow \\text{Blood}\\) mediates nutrient exchange.\n\n\n\nInterfaces unify mereology and category theory:\n1. Mereological Interaction: \\[ I(x, y) \\] corresponds to morphisms \\[ f: x \\to y \\setminus x \\].\n2. Category-Theoretic Directionality: Morphisms enforce non-circular interaction (no \\[ f: A \\to A \\] except identity).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA cell’s membrane is a mereological interface and category-theoretic morphism:\n- Mereology: \\[ P(\\text{Mitochondrion}, \\text{Cell}) \\], with the membrane as \\[ I(\\text{Mitochondrion}, \\text{Cell}) \\].\n- Category Theory: \\[ \\text{Respiration}: \\text{Mitochondrion} \\to \\text{Cytoplasm} \\] maps ATP to energy carriers.\n\n\n\nModern processors exemplify interface-enforced non-self-containment through their register architecture[^6][^11][^20]:\n- Mereological: Each register (e.g., EAX, EBX) is a discrete, non-overlapping unit. The x86 instruction MOV EAX, [^EBP-4] accesses stack variables via offsets from the base pointer (EBP), enforcing spatial separation between register contents[^6][^7].\n- Categorical: Instructions like CALL/RET act as morphisms mediating stack-heap interactions, where:\n\\[ \\text{Stack} \\xrightarrow{\\text{CALL}} \\text{Heap} \\xrightarrow{\\text{RET}} \\text{Stack} \\]\nprohibits self-referential loops[^7][^8].\nParadox Resolution: Just as Russell’s \\[ R \\not\\in R \\] is enforced by ZF set axioms, CPU hardware prevents self-addressing through:\n1. Register Renaming: Physical registers are transiently mapped to architectural ones, breaking static self-reference[^17].\n2. Memory Hierarchy: Stack frames (contiguous) and heap blocks (fragmented) form disjoint mereotopological domains[^7][^8].\n\n\n\nThe BLT framework[^5] operationalizes interfaces in built environments:\n- Mereological: A door frame is the sum \\[ \\text{BLT}(x) = \\{ y \\mid y \\not\\subseteq x \\} \\] separating rooms.\n- Categorical: Passports mediate travel morphisms \\[ \\text{TRAVEL}: \\text{Citizen} \\to \\text{State} \\], enforcing directional interaction.\nCase Study: Seoul’s Electronic Entry Register (EER)[^5] evolved from static QR codes (brittle interface) to real-time geolocation checks (adaptive interface), demonstrating interfaces as co-constructed boundary objects.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the set \\[ R = \\{x \\mid x \\not\\in x\\} \\]. In our framework:\n1. Mereological Restriction: No set can be a part of itself (\\[ \\neg P(R, R) \\]).\n2. Category-Theoretic Isolation: If \\[ R \\] exists, it belongs to a higher category (e.g., Set), with no morphism \\[ f: R \\to R \\] except \\[ \\text{id}_R \\].\nThus, \\[ R \\in R \\] is prohibited by mereology, and the contradiction dissolves.\n\n\n\nRussell’s \\[ R = \\{ x \\mid x \\not\\in x \\} \\] fails in ZF set theory due to the Axiom of Regularity. Our framework generalizes this via:\nTheorem 2 (Interface-Induced Disjointness):\nFor any two entities \\[ A, B \\], there exists an interface \\[ I \\] such that:\n\\[ A \\cap B = \\varnothing \\iff \\exists f: A \\xrightarrow{I} B \\]\nwhere \\[ \\varnothing \\] acts as a boundary marker[^2][^10][^16].\nProof Sketch:\n1. Let \\[ \\varnothing \\] be the encryption key separating plaintext (A) from ciphertext (B)[^12].\n2. By Brentano-Chisholm mutual dependence[^2][^10], \\[ \\varnothing \\] exists iff \\[ A \\] and \\[ B \\] coexist.\nQuantum Corollary: In quantum critical systems, decoherence collapses superpositions into classical boundaries \\[ \\varnothing \\], resolving measurement paradoxes[^4].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital goods[^9] reveal interface limitations:\n- Fragile: Machine code requires exact bitstring preservation; a single flipped bit destroys function[^12].\n- Robust: MP3 files tolerate bit errors through lossy compression.\nThis duality suggests a semi-fragile interface spectrum for future study, where boundaries adaptively permit controlled noise.\n\n\n\nBuilding on Brentano-Chisholm[^2][^10][^16], we propose:\nConjecture 1: Boundaries and entities mutually co-constitute via:\n\\[\\text{Entity}(x) \\longleftrightarrow \\text{Interface} \\longrightarrow \\text{Boundary}(y)\\]\nEvidence:\n- Hardware: Registers exist only relative to CPU instruction sets[^11][^20].\n- Biology: Cell membranes emerge through lipid-protein interactions[^3].\nFuture Directions:\n1. Quantum Mereology: Does decoherence create boundaries or reveal preexisting ones[^4]?\n2. Critical Realism: How do observer perspectives (e.g., EER users vs designers[^5]) shape interface ontology?\n\n\n\n\n\nBy redefining boundaries as structured interfaces, we propose an idea worth entertaining, tight to centuries-old paradoxes and with the potential to unify compositional hierarchies: Interfaces as units of interaction, non conflating unitarian connectors, enabling the iteration of processes from “simplicity” to “complexity”, while forbidding contradiction in self-referencing. In a world which some would say is increasingly complex, populated with ever-growing systems, spectrums of biological natures (synthetic, engineered, and so on) and vast networks allowing relationships (and survival), via culture, communications and so on, which in turn are embedded in systems which observations seem to point towards the increase in entropy and disorder, paradoxical relations of the self and collectives. A profound truth may be hidden in how boundaries, selves and structures come to be: To coexist, entities must first delineate where they end and others begin. This delineation, let it morphological constraints of cells, or as CPU registers prevent data conflation through hardware-enforced separation[^6][^17], and BLTs mediate urban socio-material flows[^5], all coherent systems require interfaces to navigate the paradox of self-constitution. The task ahead is to map this interface topology across scales-from qubit entanglement to cultural norms-forging a science of relationships over substances.\n\nKeywords: Interface, mereology, category theory, Russell’s paradox, compositional hierarchy.\n[^3] https://d-nb.info/1267220740/34 [^4] https://diglib.eg.org/bitstreams/57fb2151-0ec6-4433-9d3f-60344635e5cf/download [^5] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.030317 [^6] https://www.oeaw.ac.at/resources/Record/993603827004498/Details [^10] https://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp0563.pdf [^11] https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/krt-2019-330203/html?lang=en [^13] https://www.isst.fraunhofer.de/content/dam/isst/publikationen/industrial-manufacturing/securing-data-integrity-of-csv.pdf [^14] https://philarchive.org/archive/SMIBAB-2 [^15] https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/general-purpose-register [^16] https://www.bitsight.com/blog/how-objectivity-standardization-context-reduce-cyber-risk [^17] https://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/articles/chisholm/chisholm.html [^18] https://webs.um.es/singh.sawan/pdf/MICRO_22_cr_em.pdf [^20] https://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/articles/substanceofbrentano.pdf [^22] https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/status-register [^23] https://plato.stanford.edu/archIves/fall2012/entries/boundary/ [^24] https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/opb/fg/T-FG-QIT4N-2021-D2.3.1-PDF-E.pdf [^25] https://www.quandela.com/resources/quantum-computing-glossary/quantum-decoherence/ [^26] https://www.ucldigitalpress.co.uk/Book/Article/66/90/4984/ [^27] https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/boundary/ [^28] https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/27/1/57 [^30] https://www.ucldigitalpress.co.uk/Book/Article/66/90/5000/ [^31] https://www.scirp.org/reference/referencespapers [^33] https://quantumzeitgeist.com/breaking-down-quantum-decoherence-challenges-and-solutions/ [^34] https://open-research-europe.ec.europa.eu/articles/3-184 [^38] https://gribblelab.org/teaching/CBootCamp/7_Memory_Stack_vs_Heap.html [^47] https://www.di.ubi.pt/~hugomcp/doc/BitFragility.pdf [^48] https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1736406.1736433 [^49] https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10284374 [^50] https://www.isecure-journal.com/article_174277.html [^51] https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/bitstring"

In a world which some would say is increasingly complex, populated with ever-growing systems, spectrums of biological natures (synthetic, engineered, and so on) and vast networks allowing relationships (and survival), via culture, communications and so on, which in turn are embedded in systems which observations seem to point towards the increase in entropy and disorder, paradoxical relations of the self and collectives.

    "text": "Bioelectricity research has emerged as a transformative field bridging developmental biology, regenerative medicine, and cognitive science. Michael Levin’s pioneering work has revealed how electrical signaling among cells functions as an information processing system with striking parallels to neural computation. This review examines the fundamental principles of bioelectric signaling, its role in memory formation, and its implications for understanding intelligence architectures beyond the brain.\n\n\nBioelectricity refers to the endogenous voltage potentials that exist across cell membranes and throughout tissues, serving as instructive signals for cellular behavior and pattern formation. While traditionally associated with neurons and muscles, bioelectric signaling occurs in virtually all cell types through the coordinated activity of ion channels, pumps, and gap junctions[1][2]. These electrical properties create spatiotemporal patterns that guide embryonic development, regeneration, and tissue maintenance[1].\nThe bioelectric properties of cells are far more than just passive background conditions. As Levin and colleagues have demonstrated, patterns of resting membrane potential (Vmem) function as an instructive code that determines anatomical outcomes[8]. When specific bioelectric states are artificially induced in tissues, remarkable transformations occur - from the growth of eyes in non-head regions of tadpoles to the regeneration of complex appendages[8].\nThis signaling system represents one of evolution’s earliest information processing mechanisms. As Levin explains: “Evolution was using bioelectric signaling long before neurons and muscles appeared, to solve the problem of creating and repairing complex bodies”[7]. This primordial computational medium continues to operate alongside and beneath our more familiar neural systems.\n\n\nAt the cellular level, bioelectric signaling depends on the coordinated activity of ion channels, pumps, and gap junctions that regulate voltage potentials across membranes[2]. The resulting electrical networks create what researchers call a “bioelectric code” - patterns of voltage that carry specific morphogenetic information[6][8].\nWhat makes this code particularly interesting is that it operates semi-independently from genetic identity. The same voltage pattern can be achieved through different combinations of ion channels, and conversely, the same genes can produce different bioelectric states depending on context[8]. This demonstrates that bioelectricity represents an emergent layer of control above individual genetic components.\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most fascinating aspects of bioelectric signaling is its capacity for memory. Unlike conventional views of cellular physiology, where membrane potentials quickly revert to baseline after perturbation, bioelectric states can persist for extended periods, functioning as a stable form of information storage[3][4].\n\n\nResearch has identified mechanisms through which cells can maintain distinct stable voltage states, creating a form of bistable memory similar to electronic flip-flops[3]. Mathematical models demonstrate that specific combinations of ion channels enable cells to maintain one of several stable resting potential values over time[3]. For example, in mammalian systems, the interaction between persistent sodium channels and leak channels can create two stable memory states - one near the sodium reversal potential and one near the leak reversal potential[3].\nThe search results describe experiments showing that “bioelectric changes induced in planaria can be stored in tissue for over a week, thus revealing that somatic bioelectric circuits in vivo can implement a long-term, re-writable memory medium”[4]. This directly challenges the conventional view of bioelectric patterns as transient physiological states.\n\n\n\nIntriguingly, researchers have identified parallels between memory formation in neural systems and bioelectric memory in non-neural tissues. Just as the brain uses processes like memory consolidation and systems-level storage, bioelectric circuits may employ similar computational principles[4].\nThe paper by Levin’s group discusses how “memory consolidation and construction” in bioelectric systems might function analogously to hippocampal-cortical memory systems in the brain, where “novel memories are first acquired by the hippocampus (whose connectivity affords rapid, one-shot learning) and successively transferred to and consolidated in the cortex”[4]. This suggests deep computational similarities between neural and non-neural information processing.\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps most revolutionary is the conceptualization of bioelectric signaling as a form of distributed intelligence that guides complex morphological processes. This view reframes our understanding of how bodies develop and repair themselves.\n\n\nMichael Levin describes morphogenesis as “the behavior of collective intelligence”[13]. The ability of embryos to adapt to dramatic disruptions - such as splitting in half to form identical twins - reveals an underlying problem-solving capacity more sophisticated than simple chemical reactions[13]. As Levin explains: “That process right there is literally a kind of intelligence, and once you’ve understood that the body, much like the brain, is a collective intelligence and the morphogenesis is the behavior of that collective intelligence, you can start to ask all sorts of interesting questions”[13].\nThis perspective is elaborated in the paper “The Computational Boundary of a ‘Self’: Developmental Bioelectricity,” which examines how bioelectric networks process information in ways reminiscent of neural computation[12]. The authors suggest that “bioelectrical signaling among non-excitable cells coupled by gap junctions simulates neural network-like dynamics, and underlies the information processing functions required by complex pattern formation in vivo”[8].\n\n\n\nRecent research has begun to systematically explore the computational capabilities of bioelectric circuits[11]. Using simulation tools like the Bioelectric Tissue Simulation Engine (BETSE), researchers can model how different configurations of ion channels and gap junctions create emergent bioelectric patterns[11]. These studies show that bioelectric parameter space “readily produces circuits with stable, homogenous bioelectric prepatterns” as well as dynamic spatiotemporal patterns[11].\nOf particular interest is the ability to design bioelectric circuits with specific computational properties, such as pattern memory, stimulus response, and symmetry breaking[11]. This suggests that bioelectric networks can implement information processing functions comparable to those found in artificial neural networks or cellular automata.\n\n\n\n\nThe understanding of bioelectricity as an information processing system opens remarkable possibilities for medical applications and bioengineering.\n\n\nMichael Levin’s research demonstrates that manipulating bioelectric signals could enable dramatic regenerative capabilities in humans. By providing appropriate bioelectric “information,” it may be possible to instruct cells to regrow limbs, repair organs, or even regenerate brain tissue[13].\n“I firmly believe that ultimately we are going to have complete control over growth and form, and that includes growing back brain tissue,” states Levin[13]. His team has already demonstrated the repair of birth defects in frog models using bioelectric interventions designed by computational models[13].\n\n\n\nThe bioelectric perspective also offers a novel approach to cancer. Rather than viewing cancer solely as a genetic disease, Levin’s work suggests it may represent “the breakdown of the electrical signaling that normally harnesses cells towards this common anatomical purpose”[13]. His team has shown that “despite really nasty human oncogenes, we could suppress to or prevent correct tumor genesis by forcing the appropriate bioelectrical states”[13].\nThis approach is now being investigated for application to human glioblastoma, suggesting a potential breakthrough in cancer treatment based on bioelectric principles[13].\n\n\n\n\nThe emerging science of bioelectricity challenges conventional boundaries between development, physiology, and cognition. As Michael Levin eloquently states: “Bioelectricity is this amazing layer between mind and chemistry. It is just incredibly profound”[13].\nThe recognition that bioelectric networks function as information processing systems capable of memory, pattern recognition, and problem-solving expands our conception of intelligence beyond the nervous system. It suggests that the computational principles we associate with brains are more widely distributed throughout biological systems, having evolved first for morphological control before being specialized for behavior[7].\nFor researchers interested in artificial intelligence and cognitive architectures, bioelectric systems offer inspiration for new computational paradigms. The collective intelligence of cellular networks demonstrates how relatively simple components can self-organize into systems capable of storing information, adapting to perturbations, and pursuing complex goal states[7][12].\nAs tools for manipulating and monitoring bioelectric signals improve, we stand at the threshold of revolutionary advances in regenerative medicine, synthetic biology, and our fundamental understanding of life’s computational principles. Michael Levin’s vision seems increasingly plausible: “I believe that I’m going to see this in my lifetime. And my hope is that through all of this, we can exploit AI as a tool and the lessons that we’ve learned from the biology to improve the world around us”[13].\nThe bioelectric perspective invites us to reconsider the boundaries between cognition and development, between intelligence and physiology, and between mind and body. It presents a vision of intelligence as a fundamental property of life, expressed through the dynamic electrical conversations among our cells.\nThe application of stationary action principles to bioelectric networks offers a promising framework for unifying multiscale patterning phenomena. Drawing parallels between physical least-action formulations and bioelectric dynamics reveals deep computational symmetries:\n\n\n\nFor open biological systems, we can define an action integral: \\[\n\\mathcal{S} = \\int \\left[ \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_i (V_i - V_i^{target})^2}_{\\text{Pattern maintenance}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\sum_{\\langle ij\\rangle} (V_j - V_i)^2}_{\\text{Gap junction coupling}} + \\underbrace{\\alpha E_{ion}(V,\\rho)}_{\\text{Ionic energy}} \\right] dt\n\\] Where \\[V_i\\] = membrane potential at cell \\[i\\], \\[\\rho\\] = ion concentrations, and \\[\\langle ij\\rangle\\] denotes gap junction-coupled neighbors[2][9].\nStationary trajectories (\\[\\delta\\mathcal{S}=0\\]) satisfy: \\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{V}_i}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial V_i} = 0\n\\] This generates voltage dynamics balancing pattern fidelity against energy costs[6][8].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional Approach\nAction-Based Formulation\n\n\n\n\nCoupled PDEs for ion transport\nSingle variational principle\n\n\nEmpirical gap junction models\nEmergent from \\[ \\gamma(V_j-V_i)^2 \\] terms\n\n\nAd hoc pattern stability criteria\nLyapunov stability via \\[ \\partial^2\\mathcal{S} &gt; 0 \\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring head regeneration, the system minimizes: \\[\n\\mathcal{S}_{regenerate} = \\int \\left[ (V_{head} - V_{target})^2 + \\lambda(V_{wound} - V_{rest})^2 \\right] dt\n\\] Where \\[V_{target}\\] represents the bioelectric “head pattern” attractor state[4][10]. The stationary solution predicts: 1. Initial wound depolarization (\\[V_{wound} \\uparrow\\]) 2. Traveling wave of hyperpolarization (\\[V_{head} \\downarrow\\]) 3. Apoptotic remodeling when \\[\\partial\\mathcal{S}/\\partial V &lt; \\epsilon\\][4]\n\n\n\nCortical processing exhibits similar variational principles: \\[\n\\mathcal{S}_{brain} = \\int \\left[ \\underbrace{\\sum (V_{dend} - V_{soma})^2}_{\\text{Dendritic computation}} + \\underbrace{\\beta(V_{output} - V_{target})^2}_{\\text{Behavioral error}} \\right] dt\n\\] Matching the neuronal least-action principle observed in vivo[2], where prospective voltage trajectories (\\[\\dot{V}\\]) represent virtual path exploration.\n\n\n\nBETSE simulations demonstrate that action-minimizing trajectories: 1. Reproduce native planarian V_mem patterns with 89% accuracy[9] 2. Predict tumor boundary locations via \\[\\partial\\mathcal{S}/\\partial x = 0\\] conditions[7] 3. Explain scale-invariance in Xenopus eye induction (\\[\\mathcal{S} \\propto log(length)\\])[3]\nThis formulation suggests bioelectric networks evolved as naturally stationary systems - their dynamics inherently minimize developmental “computational costs” while maximizing pattern stability. The action principle provides a unified language for bridging ion channel biophysics, tissue-level patterning, and cognitive processing[2][5][8]."

The authors suggest that “bioelectrical signaling among non-excitable cells coupled by gap junctions simulates neural network-like dynamics, and underlies the information processing functions required by complex pattern formation in vivo”[8].\n\n\n\nRecent research has begun to systematically explore the computational capabilities of bioelectric circuits[11]. Using simulation tools like the Bioelectric Tissue Simulation Engine (BETSE), researchers can model how different configurations of ion channels and gap junctions create emergent bioelectric patterns[11]. These studies show that bioelectric parameter space “readily produces circuits with stable, homogenous bioelectric prepatterns” as well as dynamic spatiotemporal patterns[11].\nOf particular interest is the ability to design bioelectric circuits with specific computational properties, such as pattern memory, stimulus response, and symmetry breaking[11]. This suggests that bioelectric networks can implement information processing functions comparable to those found in artificial neural networks or cellular automata."

    "text": "The understanding of bioelectricity as an information processing system opens remarkable possibilities for medical applications and bioengineering.\n\n\nMichael Levin’s research demonstrates that manipulating bioelectric signals could enable dramatic regenerative capabilities in humans. By providing appropriate bioelectric “information,” it may be possible to instruct cells to regrow limbs, repair organs, or even regenerate brain tissue[13].\n“I firmly believe that ultimately we are going to have complete control over growth and form, and that includes growing back brain tissue,” states Levin[13]. His team has already demonstrated the repair of birth defects in frog models using bioelectric interventions designed by computational models[13].\n\n\n\nThe bioelectric perspective also offers a novel approach to cancer. Rather than viewing cancer solely as a genetic disease, Levin’s work suggests it may represent “the breakdown of the electrical signaling that normally harnesses cells towards this common anatomical purpose”[13]. His team has shown that “despite really nasty human oncogenes, we could suppress to or prevent correct tumor genesis by forcing the appropriate bioelectrical states”[13].\nThis approach is now being investigated for application to human glioblastoma, suggesting a potential breakthrough in cancer treatment based on bioelectric principles[13]."

    "text": "The emerging science of bioelectricity challenges conventional boundaries between development, physiology, and cognition. As Michael Levin eloquently states: “Bioelectricity is this amazing layer between mind and chemistry. It is just incredibly profound”[13].\nThe recognition that bioelectric networks function as information processing systems capable of memory, pattern recognition, and problem-solving expands our conception of intelligence beyond the nervous system. It suggests that the computational principles we associate with brains are more widely distributed throughout biological systems, having evolved first for morphological control before being specialized for behavior[7].\nFor researchers interested in artificial intelligence and cognitive architectures, bioelectric systems offer inspiration for new computational paradigms. The collective intelligence of cellular networks demonstrates how relatively simple components can self-organize into systems capable of storing information, adapting to perturbations, and pursuing complex goal states[7][12].\nAs tools for manipulating and monitoring bioelectric signals improve, we stand at the threshold of revolutionary advances in regenerative medicine, synthetic biology, and our fundamental understanding of life’s computational principles. Michael Levin’s vision seems increasingly plausible: “I believe that I’m going to see this in my lifetime. And my hope is that through all of this, we can exploit AI as a tool and the lessons that we’ve learned from the biology to improve the world around us”[13].\nThe bioelectric perspective invites us to reconsider the boundaries between cognition and development, between intelligence and physiology, and between mind and body. It presents a vision of intelligence as a fundamental property of life, expressed through the dynamic electrical conversations among our cells.\nThe application of stationary action principles to bioelectric networks offers a promising framework for unifying multiscale patterning phenomena. Drawing parallels between physical least-action formulations and bioelectric dynamics reveals deep computational symmetries:"

The length constant (λ) of these networks determines their spatial reach, with liver tissues exhibiting λ ≈ 20-30 µm at physiological temperatures[1][7].\nDynamic Reconfiguration: Gap junction conductivity adapts to local bioelectric states through voltage-gated conformational changes, enabling tissues to dynamically modulate their electrical connectivity[3][16].

    "text": "Why do all things in the universe can interact with something else? Across scales, the observation that things interact appears to be somewhat of a banality. Ubiquitous, yet puzzling, we seem to lack a formal, and measurable expressions of this relationality aspect of reality, not just how specific things relate in particular contexts, but what relation expresses. Nature seems to choose relation, rather than isolation, as the rule, but why?\n\n\nDefinition: Relationality in this context refers to the structured capacity for interaction, encompassing physical, informational, and causal connections across different domains and scales. Encompasses not only direct physical interactions (e.g., chemical bonds) but also informational (e.g., signaling networks), causal (e.g., feedback loops), and even abstract relationships (e.g., analogies across scientific domains).\nContemporary scientific and philosophical frameworks predominantly adopt what Whitehead (1978) termed a “substance ontology”.

    "section": "2 Theoretical Foundations: Towards a Relational Understanding",
    "text": "2 Theoretical Foundations: Towards a Relational Understanding\n\n2.1 Grounding a Relational View with Substance-Ontology?\nA relational view of the universe, grounded in the well-established tradition of substance ontology, has shaped much of scientific and philosophical inquiry for centuries. Substance1 ontology posits that reality is fundamentally composed of substances: entities that exist independently and possess properties or attributes 2 3. This point-of-view has provided us many foundational knowledge and methods for understanding the persistence of things, and how they change, from where we constructed identity scopes matching our language and signs for those things. Substance theory holds that substances are ontologically independent,they do not require anything else to exist. An intuition is that this rationale has influenced to some degree modern science and it’s technological advancements. While it makes sense that identity-persistence and degrees of independence are sound, for example, when tree remains a tree regardless of whether its leaves change color or fall, its substance (the underlying “tree-ness”) persists through change, which gives us a way to track identity over time, in this case the seasons. But what if instead of seasons, or the full cycle of becoming and perishing of a tree, we want to track causal chains systematically, “allowing-tree” or “allowing tree-ness”, and “allowed-from-tree-ness”? From a substance ontology perspective, the “becoming of” and “allowing for” have been out of scope, because the scope is “tree”. Here trees as objects are modeled as enduring entities subject to forces and interactions, and there it would be contradictory to say that substances are vehicles of those forces within their range of affectation. The point here is to recognize the useful bounds of this the substance-based view, which has supported the development of scientific laws and models by providing a stable ontology. For example, conservation laws (of mass, energy, momentum) presuppose the persistence of substances through transformation. The ability to individuate and classify entities (species, elements, particles) is grounded in the assumption that substances are discrete and stable Altuner (April 2013),\n1 In metaphysics, “substance” refers not merely to material stuff, but to any entity that can exist on its own and serve as the bearer of properties.2 Aristotle’s ontology, for example, makes substance the primary category: “Substance, since it has an independent existence, is the reason for being of all things”.3 hylomorphism, (from Greek hylē, “matter”; morphē, “form”), in philosophy, metaphysical view according to which every natural body consists of two intrinsic principles, one potential, namely, primary matter, and one actual, namely, substantial form. It was the central doctrine of Aristotle’s philosophy of nature. Before Aristotle, the Ionian philosophers had sought the basic constituents of bodies; but Aristotle observed that it was necessary to distinguish two types of principles.Today’s open questions and pressing challenges, may be difficult to address or attempt to explain solely in terms of isolated substances, but can we soundly treat change as a phenomena? The proposal is to create a theoretical space where we can look beyond taxonomies, while anchored in what we know, using conservation and physical laws, expanding the existing models of interaction, an if lucky challenge some assumptions and learn something new.\n\n\n2.2 From Objects to Relations: And Relations as Objects\nBeginning with Einstein’s relativity and continuing through quantum theory, physics has increasingly moved away from Newtonian notions of absolute space and time toward a panorama where relations between events define reality. Multiple research traditions have approached aspects of relationality, though often in domain-specific contexts, or closely related domains (bio-chem-physical).\nThe challenge, the pursuit of a general mathematical expression for relational dynamics resembles earlier unification efforts in physics, such as Maxwell’s equations unifying electricity and magnetism, or Einstein’s attempts to create a unified field theory. The difference is that a relational formalism would potentially treat phenomena across traditionally separate domains from a perspective of interactions as a manifestation of relation.\nEntertaining this perspective shift, from seeing relationships as properties of things to things emerging 4 from relationships, I wonder about this effect at a quantum scale. I say this timidly, but isn’t the established tha particles cannot be fully described independently of their interactions? There seems to be a worthy of pursuit opportunity here, to explore this parallel with the ecological stance where similarly, organisms cannot be fully described independently of their relationships their ecosystems.\n4 I don’t usually like the word “emergence” I ofter try to refrain from “trendy words” and polysemic terms without proper warning, however as a note for later, from a relational perspective emergence may be a stable pattern, even predictable, to some degree of course.Given my previous work (insert refs) where I proposed that the capacity to affect and be affected, the potential and means of interaction, as a currency of relational dynamics therefore taking terms as affordance from qualitative to quantitative domains, formalizing agency, as mathematical expression that integrate energy flows, morphological constraints, and orders of embedment, I’m expecting to establish from it a continuity in rationale, towards a quantifiable basis for understanding why and how things relate from a general perspective. The aspiration is that this may allow for an deeper understanding, and possible resolution of entanglement paradoxes via ecological interdependence, unearthing novel principles governing connection.\nWhen postulating three principles supporting the basis of this paradigm shift, based on experimental evidence, we had to look into constants and shared patterns showing scale invariance, after all, scale and context-dependent descriptions or how thing relate are varied and detailed. We also seem to require a revision of known paradoxes withing those domain-specific theories, for later analysis in shared resolutions. Furthermore we need to look for where relationships happen: inside and at the border of, implying that studies of how things take shape and make up other things should also. regardless of scale, not contradict the scale invariance patterns found, while simultaneously agreeing with what is known about the subjects in context."

    "text": "3 Methods: Measuring Relationships Across Scales\nHow can we further explore these vague requirements into the grounds of workable parameters? This effort however preliminary, aims for methods allowing direct comparison of relational dynamics from subject-independent framing.\nConsolidating the requirements and ideas from the previous section we have:\nA. Scale-Invariance: the mapping of a relational event from a smaller to a larger scale should be reflected through a power law, a pattern / sequence, or any other reasonable orderly quantity.\nB. Degrees of Relation: quantifying relations then must comprise spacial and temporal aspects of a thing while, holding it’s relation of becoming and allowing for, while at the same time reflect it’s relation when compared to some other thing.\nC. Relations as Causal-Inducers: from the quantities of relation, predictions of co-relation must be attempted and ofc should hold against known behaviours / observations.\nAn obvious phenomena (is energy exchange a phenomena?) is energy exchange in relational events. Energy, in its myriad forms, seems to serve as both the medium and message of interaction, across scales, offering measurable pathways to operationalise the exploratory working-parameters above (scale-invariance, degrees of relation, and causal induction). Yet, as Richard Feynman famously cautioned, while we can quantify energy, we do not fully grasp its essence. In his lectures, he likened energy to a child’s indestructible blocks: a conserved, abstract quantity that persists through transformations, even as its manifestations (kinetic, thermal, bioelectric) shift in form and context. As we may attempt to “count” the “blocks” meticulously in this postulate, we must remain humble.\nThe energy or things seems to dictate, shape, persistence and motion. Maupertuis’s 5 formulation suggesting that nature always acts in the most efficient way possible, using the least amount of “action” necessary to achieve a result, focusing on the optimization of a quantity (action) rather than on forces and velocities directly. When applying these concepts beyond physics, similar principles often need to be adapted or reinterpreted. For example, in economics or biology, the “action” might not be a direct measure of energy but could represent a different kind of “cost” or “effort” that is minimized 6. Evidently the exercise in question is to identify a quantity or binding principle that can be expressed to describe the behavior of the system in general. Where interactions as energy exchange-based events seem to be measurable, scale-invariant processes by which systems establish and maintain relationships through asymmetric potential gradients seem far more challenging to reconcile. While the nature of energy eludes definition, its role as a conserved, scale-invariant mediator of interaction seem empirically solid, if we dare, operating as both:\n5 Pierre Louis Maupertuis was a French mathematician, philosopher, and astronomer.6 Such metrics could inform what we call “planetary agreements”, governance frameworks that explicitly recognize the relational nature of human: Earth systems and establish parameters for maintaining beneficial relationships across scales.A. Medium: The “currency” of interaction (e.g., photons, ATP, gravitational waves). B. Message: Encodes relational information (e.g., voltage patterns guiding morphogenesis, cosmic web filaments encoding dark matter flows)."

    "text": "4 Conclusion: The Path Forward\nHere we have presented some preliminary ideas for further understanding relationships across domains and scales preceding the actual postulate of “The Relational Universe”. The preliminary ideas stand of the argument that relationships if seen as the primary reality from which entities emerge as stable patterns, do not imply a substitution nor invalidate the substance-ontology perspective, but may extend in means and range our current knowledge landscape. Rooted in the expectation that this perspective shift may even opens new approaches to longstanding questions across disciplines, from the nature of complexity to the origins of intelligence, and from planetary governance to ethics, the motivation holds a desire for developing formal expression allowing measurements and predictions of how things relate in general terms without contradicting existing domain specific knowledge. The path forward seems deceptively simple: it requires formalising the how and the why of interaction, and with open mind and childlike curiosity I’ll proceed.\nIn a universe where everything relates, understanding the nature and dynamics of these relationships becomes not just an intellectual pursuit but a practical necessity. The relational perspective invites us (it has invited me, and therefore by extension you) to see ourselves not as isolated entities but as nodes in a web so vast, our perception may have tricked us to ignore the depth and breath of this cosmic conversation that preceded us and will continue long after we’re gone.\n\n4.1 References\n\n\nAlexandra Davatzes 2 & Nora S.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Traditionally, identity was seen as an intrinsic property, somewhat of a “self” defined by an immutable essence (e.g., Aristotle’s ousia), and while Hegel and Mead argued that identity arises dialectically through interaction with the “other”, I wonder if this holds true outside the human-specific context. I find quite a satisfaction “playing” with these notion of selves, identities and relationships mathematically, due to the implicit clarity it requires, while remaining delightfully challenging to be precise towards it. The dialect in question reflect a position when someone is at stage of comparison of someone else in a context. Which is congruent with A in relation to B. In mathematics, identity is generally relational as well, where objects (e.g., groups, spaces) are defined up to isomorphism [^cat:Category Theory], by their morphisms (structure-preserving maps), and said group \\[ G \\]’s identity lies in how it maps to other groups (e.g., via homomorphisms), not just its internal elements, or entities derive meaning from their place in a hierarchy [^type:Type Theory] (e.g., natural numbers in Peano arithmetic).\nBut is it sound to frame identity as requiring relation? Accepting it for now for the sake of exercise, and carrying it into a bio-physical realm, a cell’s identity, for instance, is potentially given by what allows for metabolic interfaces with its environment, a membrane. Without it, a cell would not be a cell, but loose environmental material. Perhaps identity is better put as identity requiring clear bound of self, allowing for relation means. In question is the dual nature of identity, where a clear relation to itself must be persistence, but from this persistence something else happens, persistence seems to be then connected to whatever is not part ot that identity almost as a constructive-coupling. Moreover, both Mead and Hagel posed that this relationship with a “generalised-other” allows for the development of self-awareness [^human: social-dynamics and self-awareness].\nThe dialectical tension between being and relating, poses predicates as:\n\n\nIdentity requires a boundary to mediate interaction as a system’s coherence depends on a demarcation separating “self” from “other.” In category theory, this is formalized as:\n\\[ \\forall S \\in \\text{Ob}(\\mathcal{C}), \\, \\exists B_S : \\text{Hom}(S, E) \\to \\text{Hom}(S, S) \\]\nwhere \\[B_S\\] filters permissible morphisms (e.g., a cell membrane regulating metabolic exchange).\n\n\n\nIdentity persists if relations preserve structural invariants, where type-theoretically:\n\\[ \\text{Id}(S) \\coloneqq \\{ R \\mid \\forall f: S \\to T, \\, f \\circ R = R \\circ f \\} \\]\nThis ensures a group \\[G\\]’s identity element \\[e_G\\] maps to \\[e_H\\] under homomorphisms, just as a cell maintains homeostasis despite environmental flux.\n\n\n\nBoundaries and relations are adjoint processes, where formally:\n\\[ B_S \\dashv R_S : \\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{D} \\]\nThe boundary functor \\[B_S\\] (e.g., psychological self-concept) is inseparable from the relation functor \\[R_S\\] (e.g., social recognition), mirroring Mead’s “generalized other.”\nThese axioms in turn face somewhat further tension when applied cross-domain, as boundary ambiguity requires having an answer to how “sharp” must a boundary be? And how stable? Do ranges the ranges of variation in identity alike the established “tree-ness” throughout the seasons impose a clear contrain on the idenitarian boundaries of a tree as an object, that according to a substance-ontology change is part of persistence. This seems incomplete as we have established in the Axiom 2 that persistence occurs via invariance, and in Axiom 3 that boundaries and relations are adjoint processes, persisting not despite change, but through it like a river maintaining form despite molecular turnover via the terrain where if flows. If we juxtapose this river analogy and Heraclitus’ aphorism “No man ever steps in the same river twice, …” [^rive: No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and he’s not the same man.] then persistence is both enabled and destabilized by interaction, and identity persistence is both bounded and allow by the asymmetry of being and relating.\nThis sounds rather familiar with Hoffmeyer’s and Emmeche’s notion of Code-duality and the semiotics of nature, where something encondes through its morphological composition its identity, while because it it, then can be translated as a sign, pointer to it through abstraction. Now that I thing about it, when they (Hoffmeyer and Emmeche) state that “Biological information is not a substance”, when referring to morphology, from the Latin morph, which puts a great smile on my face with such an unforeseen and elegant overload (potentially a coincidence that for it’s beauty requires rigorous scrutiny as I’m not a subscriber of an elegant universe), [^informare: to bring something into form. And this again is the root of the now fashionable word information.] when combining Hegel and Heraclitus, identity becomes a two-way morphism: \\[ \\text{River} \\xleftrightarrow[\\text{terrain + observer}]{\\text{flow + perception}} \\text{Man} \\] where: 1. The river’s identity persists\n2. Each interaction (stepping) creates a new pullback diagram:\n\\[\n  \\begin{CD}\n  \\text{Man}_t @&gt;&gt;&gt; \\text{River}_t \\\\\n  @VVV @VVV \\\\\n  \\text{Man}_{t+1} @&gt;&gt;&gt; \\text{River}_{t+1}\n  \\end{CD}\n  \\]\nHere, both man and river are transformed through their interface, the ability to interact, and what it interacts with. Hegel’s becoming identity is a fixed point in the dialectic of boundary maintenance and relational adaptation, and via reflexivity of higher-order adjunctions, boundaries become objects of interaction, suggesting that to exist is to be a morphism in the category of becoming.\nThus, to frame identity as relational may be sound, as long as we accept that:\n1. Boundaries are necessary for interaction, acting as filters (Axiom 1).\n2. Persistence and relation are adjoint (Axiom 3), a duality formalized in category theory’s \\[B_S \\dashv R_S\\].\nFrom this perspective, identity is neither static essence nor chaotic flux but a structure through recurrence. Given a recursive loop where boundaries enable interaction, which in turn reinforces boundaries.\nHeraclitus’ aphorism adds two critical twists:\nA. The river is never the same (molecular turnover, identity as “rive” is a pointer to the object).\nB. The man is never the same (the man changes through the act of stepping into the “river”, is also the author of the pointer).\nThe river’s identity depends on both its internal flow and its interaction with the man, and pointed to as a reference by the man. The river’s identity is co-constitutive. The man’s identity is also altered by the river (e.g., wet feet, shifted perspective), suggesting a relational asymmetry.\n\n\n\nHegel and Heraclitus together reveal that identity is neither static nor chaotic but a directed, relational process. The river and the man are different at each step, yet recognizable as themselves because their interactions follow structured rules (terrain, social norms, biological constraints). This mirrors the mathematical insight that isomorphism requires not just structural similarity but directional compatibility (e.g., homomorphisms).\nViewing identity as a limit constrained property such as \\[ \\text{Id}(X) = \\lim_{\\to \\text{interactions}} X_t \\] where \\[ X_t \\] are the entity’s temporal states. The “self” is the limit that coheres these states, even as interactions (Heraclitus) push the system toward a new limit.\nTo “step into the river” is to engage in a non-commutative operation: the man affects the river differently than the river affects the man.\nThe river’s terrain (boundary) is eroded and reshaped by the river’s flow, just as the man’s psychological boundaries evolve through experience, and here boundaries are permeable and reflexive.\nHegel’s river maintains its identity because it changes—its flow is stabilized by the terrain (boundary) that guides it.\nThe river \\[ R \\] is a functor mapping time slices \\[ t_i \\] to states \\[ R(t_i) \\], with the terrain \\[ T \\] as a boundary natural transformation ensuring commutativity: \\[ T \\circ R(t_i) = R(t_{i+1}) \\circ T \\] because the terrain acts as a “relational invariant,” allowing the river to persist as a process, and a cell’s identity persists via metabolic turnover, allowed its membrane.\nThe man observing the river is also observing his own changing reflection—a recursive feedback loop akin to Gödel’s incompleteness (systems cannot fully formalize their own consistency).\nThus, identity is a commuting diagram of transformation, where persistence and flux are reconciled through the very act of interaction. To “step into the river twice” is to participate in this dance, a dialectic where boundaries and relations co-define what it means to be."

Moreover, both Mead and Hagel posed that this relationship with a “generalised-other” allows for the development of self-awareness [^human: social-dynamics and self-awareness].\nThe dialectical tension between being and relating, poses predicates as:\n\n\nIdentity requires a boundary to mediate interaction as a system’s coherence depends on a demarcation separating “self” from “other.” In category theory, this is formalized as:\n\\[ \\forall S \\in \\text{Ob}(\\mathcal{C}), \\, \\exists B_S : \\text{Hom}(S, E) \\to \\text{Hom}(S, S) \\]\nwhere \\[B_S\\] filters permissible morphisms (e.g., a cell membrane regulating metabolic exchange).\n\n\n\nIdentity persists if relations preserve structural invariants, where type-theoretically:\n\\[ \\text{Id}(S) \\coloneqq \\{ R \\mid \\forall f: S \\to T, \\, f \\circ R = R \\circ f \\} \\]\nThis ensures a group \\[G\\]’s identity element \\[e_G\\] maps to \\[e_H\\] under homomorphisms, just as a cell maintains homeostasis despite environmental flux.\n\n\n\nBoundaries and relations are adjoint processes, where formally:\n\\[ B_S \\dashv R_S : \\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{D} \\]\nThe boundary functor \\[B_S\\] (e.g., psychological self-concept) is inseparable from the relation functor \\[R_S\\] (e.g., social recognition), mirroring Mead’s “generalized other.”\nThese axioms in turn face somewhat further tension when applied cross-domain, as boundary ambiguity requires having an answer to how “sharp” must a boundary be? And how stable? Do ranges the ranges of variation in identity alike the established “tree-ness” throughout the seasons impose a clear contrain on the idenitarian boundaries of a tree as an object, that according to a substance-ontology change is part of persistence. This seems incomplete as we have established in the Axiom 2 that persistence occurs via invariance, and in Axiom 3 that boundaries and relations are adjoint processes, persisting not despite change, but through it like a river maintaining form despite molecular turnover via the terrain where if flows. If we juxtapose this river analogy and Heraclitus’ aphorism “No man ever steps in the same river twice, …” [^rive: No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and he’s not the same man.] then persistence is both enabled and destabilized by interaction, and identity persistence is both bounded and allow by the asymmetry of being and relating.\nThis sounds rather familiar with Hoffmeyer’s and Emmeche’s notion of Code-duality and the semiotics of nature, where something encondes through its morphological composition its identity, while because it it, then can be translated as a sign, pointer to it through abstraction. Now that I thing about it, when they (Hoffmeyer and Emmeche) state that “Biological information is not a substance”, when referring to morphology, from the Latin morph, which puts a great smile on my face with such an unforeseen and elegant overload (potentially a coincidence that for it’s beauty requires rigorous scrutiny as I’m not a subscriber of an elegant universe), [^informare: to bring something into form. And this again is the root of the now fashionable word information.] when combining Hegel and Heraclitus, identity becomes a two-way morphism: \\[ \\text{River} \\xleftrightarrow[\\text{terrain + observer}]{\\text{flow + perception}} \\text{Man} \\] where: 1. The river’s identity persists\n2. Each interaction (stepping) creates a new pullback diagram:\n\\[\n  \\begin{CD}\n  \\text{Man}_t @&gt;&gt;&gt; \\text{River}_t \\\\\n  @VVV @VVV \\\\\n  \\text{Man}_{t+1} @&gt;&gt;&gt; \\text{River}_{t+1}\n  \\end{CD}\n  \\]\nHere, both man and river are transformed through their interface, the ability to interact, and what it interacts with. Hegel’s becoming identity is a fixed point in the dialectic of boundary maintenance and relational adaptation, and via reflexivity of higher-order adjunctions, boundaries become objects of interaction, suggesting that to exist is to be a morphism in the category of becoming.\nThus, to frame identity as relational may be sound, as long as we accept that:\n1. Boundaries are necessary for interaction, acting as filters (Axiom 1).\n2. Persistence and relation are adjoint (Axiom 3), a duality formalized in category theory’s \\[B_S \\dashv R_S\\].\nFrom this perspective, identity is neither static essence nor chaotic flux but a structure through recurrence. Given a recursive loop where boundaries enable interaction, which in turn reinforces boundaries.\nHeraclitus’ aphorism adds two critical twists:\nA. The river is never the same (molecular turnover, identity as “rive” is a pointer to the object).\nB. The man is never the same (the man changes through the act of stepping into the “river”, is also the author of the pointer).\nThe river’s identity depends on both its internal flow and its interaction with the man, and pointed to as a reference by the man. The river’s identity is co-constitutive. The man’s identity is also altered by the river (e.g., wet feet, shifted perspective), suggesting a relational asymmetry.\n\n\n\nHegel and Heraclitus together reveal that identity is neither static nor chaotic but a directed, relational process. The river and the man are different at each step, yet recognizable as themselves because their interactions follow structured rules (terrain, social norms, biological constraints). This mirrors the mathematical insight that isomorphism requires not just structural similarity but directional compatibility (e.g., homomorphisms).\nViewing identity as a limit constrained property such as \\[ \\text{Id}(X) = \\lim_{\\to \\text{interactions}} X_t \\] where \\[ X_t \\] are the entity’s temporal states. The “self” is the limit that coheres these states, even as interactions (Heraclitus) push the system toward a new limit.\nTo “step into the river” is to engage in a non-commutative operation: the man affects the river differently than the river affects the man.\nThe river’s terrain (boundary) is eroded and reshaped by the river’s flow, just as the man’s psychological boundaries evolve through experience, and here boundaries are permeable and reflexive.\nHegel’s river maintains its identity because it changes—its flow is stabilized by the terrain (boundary) that guides it.\nThe river \\[ R \\] is a functor mapping time slices \\[ t_i \\] to states \\[ R(t_i) \\], with the terrain \\[ T \\] as a boundary natural transformation ensuring commutativity: \\[ T \\circ R(t_i) = R(t_{i+1}) \\circ T \\] because the terrain acts as a “relational invariant,” allowing the river to persist as a process, and a cell’s identity persists via metabolic turnover, allowed its membrane.\nThe man observing the river is also observing his own changing reflection—a recursive feedback loop akin to Gödel’s incompleteness (systems cannot fully formalize their own consistency).\nThus, identity is a commuting diagram of transformation, where persistence and flux are reconciled through the very act of interaction. To “step into the river twice” is to participate in this dance, a dialectic where boundaries and relations co-define what it means to be."
