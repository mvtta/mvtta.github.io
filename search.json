    "title": "Standardized Definitions Framework: Processual Identity Theory",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Based on the comprehensive research in “On Identity: Ideas On Being & Becoming,” I present a standardized definitional framework where each concept adheres to the same formal structure and maintains logical consistency with previous definitions.\n\n\nProposed Definition: Identity is a contextually coherent process sustained by differential relations between intrinsic self-maintenance and extrinsic environmental coupling, manifesting as boundary-mediated tensions that enable persistence through change.\nFormal Requirements: - Reflexivity: ∀x(x = x)[1] - Contextual coherence conditions[2] - Structured cospan representation: S → I ← E[3][4]\nNature: Dynamic processual phenomenon that emerges from the interplay between internal organization and external adaptation, neither purely substantial nor purely relational[5][1].\nTemporal Dimension: Diachronic persistence through structured continuity patterns, where identity maintains coherence across temporal states via retract conditions[6][7].\nEmpirical Adequacy: Measurable through boundary formation, selective permeability, and organizational pattern persistence in biological, cognitive, and social systems[8][9].\nOperational Definition: Identity sheaf I_S(U) = {Properties of S observable in context U}, satisfying gluing conditions for local-to-global coherence[2][10].\nConditionals: - If retract r: E → I exists such that r ∘ S = id_I, then identity persists - If boundary formation occurs, then selective environmental coupling is enabled\nFormal Expression: Identity = lim_→(Internal Phase Separation) × lim_←(External Interaction)\nPrinciple: Identity emerges from boundary-mediated tension between self-maintenance and environmental coupling, enabling persistence through contextual coherence[11][12].\n\n\n\nProposed Definition: Being is the compositional capacity for self-maintenance through boundary formation that enables selective environmental coupling at a given organizational scale.\nFormal Requirements: - Boundary formation: ∂S = ∫_E φ(S,E) dE[11] - Self-maintenance conditions via autopoietic processes - Scalar organizational coherence across hierarchical levels\nNature: Emergent property of self-organizing systems that maintain structural integrity through selective interaction with environment[8][12].\nTemporal Dimension: Synchronic manifestation of organizational patterns that enable diachronic persistence through environmental flux[6][7].\nEmpirical Adequacy: Observable through morphological structures, metabolic interfaces, and thermodynamic boundary maintenance in physical systems[8][13].\nOperational Definition: Being as structured cospan S → I ← E where S mediates between intrinsic invariants (I) and extrinsic environment (E)[3][4].\nConditionals: - If boundary formation occurs, then selective permeability is enabled - If self-maintenance processes exist, then organizational coherence is preserved\nFormal Expression: Being = {S | ∃ boundary ∂S enabling selective coupling}\nPrinciple: Being requires the capacity to form and maintain boundaries that enable selective environmental interaction while preserving organizational coherence[11][14].\n\n\n\nProposed Definition: Belonging is the contextual participation of entities in larger organizational structures while maintaining distinct processual identity through multi-scale coherence.\nFormal Requirements: - Multi-scale coherence conditions - Part-whole relationship preservation - Hierarchical organizational consistency\nNature: Relational property that enables entities to participate in larger systems while maintaining their distinct organizational integrity[15][16].\nTemporal Dimension: Persistent participation patterns that maintain coherence across temporal scales and organizational transitions[6][17].\nEmpirical Adequacy: Measurable through functional roles, emergent properties, and hierarchical integration in complex systems[8][13].\nOperational Definition: Belonging as sheaf morphism B: Local_Identity → Global_Context preserving local coherence within global structures[2][10].\nConditionals: - If multi-scale coherence exists, then hierarchical participation is enabled - If part-whole relationships preserve identity, then belonging is maintained\nFormal Expression: Belonging = {B(S,C) | S maintains identity while participating in context C}\nPrinciple: Belonging enables multi-scale participation while preserving distinct processual identity through contextual coherence mechanisms[2][15].\n\n\n\nProposed Definition: Becoming is the processual allowance that enables identity formation through phase transitions and organizational emergence from potentiality to actuality.\nFormal Requirements: - Phase transition conditions - Emergence criteria from potentiality - Organizational pattern formation rules\nNature: Dynamic process that enables the transition from potential to actual identity through critical phase transitions and organizational emergence[8][12].\nTemporal Dimension: Directional process that enables identity formation through temporal transitions and developmental sequences[6][7].\nEmpirical Adequacy: Observable through developmental processes, phase transitions, and emergence of organizational complexity in biological and social systems[8][18].\nOperational Definition: Becoming as morphism ∅ → Identity capturing emergence from potentiality through phase transition dynamics[19][20].\nConditionals: - If phase transition occurs, then organizational emergence is enabled - If allowance conditions exist, then identity formation is possible\nFormal Expression: Becoming = {B(∅,S) | transition from potentiality to identity S}\nPrinciple: Becoming enables identity formation through allowance conditions that permit phase transitions from potential to actual organizational states[8][12].\n\n\n\nProposed Definition: Boundaries are phase-state mediators that enable selective permeability and information exchange between system and environment, constituting the operational interface for identity persistence.\nFormal Requirements: - Phase-state mediation conditions - Selective permeability functions: φ(S,E) - Information exchange regulation\nNature: Active mediating interfaces that filter and condition system-environment interactions rather than passive separating barriers[11][8].\nTemporal Dimension: Dynamic structures that adapt permeability and filtering characteristics while maintaining system-environment distinction[6][7].\nEmpirical Adequacy: Measurable through permeability coefficients, gradient maintenance, and interface dynamics in physical and biological systems[8][13].\nOperational Definition: Boundary as integral ∂S = ∫_E φ(S,E) dE where φ determines selective interaction strength[11][14].\nConditionals: - If selective permeability exists, then system-environment coupling is regulated - If boundary formation occurs, then identity persistence is enabled\nFormal Expression: ∂S = {φ(S,E) | selective permeability function enabling system-environment coupling}\nPrinciple: Boundaries enable identity persistence through selective mediation of system-environment interactions, maintaining organizational coherence while allowing adaptive coupling[11][12].\n\n\n\nProposed Definition: Processual identity is the unified framework wherein identity emerges from dynamic tension between intrinsic self-organization and extrinsic environmental coupling, formalized through structured cospans and sheaf-theoretic coherence.\nFormal Requirements: - Structured cospan representation: S → I ← E - Sheaf coherence conditions: I_S(U) with gluing properties - Retract conditions: r: E → I such that r ∘ S = id_I\nNature: Synthetic framework unifying being, belonging, and becoming through contextually coherent boundary-mediated processes[3][5].\nTemporal Dimension: Encompasses both synchronic emergence and diachronic persistence through structured continuity and adaptive change[6][7].\nEmpirical Adequacy: Integrates measurable phenomena across biological, cognitive, and social domains through unified mathematical formalism[8][18].\nOperational Definition: Processual identity as sheaf I_S(U) over structured cospan S → I ← E satisfying local-to-global coherence conditions[2][10].\nConditionals: - If structured cospan exists with retract condition, then processual identity is realized - If sheaf coherence is maintained, then contextual consistency is preserved\nFormal Expression: P_Identity = {(S→I←E, I_S(U)) | structured cospan with coherent sheaf}\nPrinciple: Processual identity provides unified framework for understanding identity as contextually coherent process sustained by boundary-mediated tension between self-maintenance and environmental coupling[11][12].\n\n\n\nThese definitions maintain logical consistency through:\n\nHierarchical Dependencies: Each definition builds upon previous concepts while adding specific formal requirements\nFormal Compatibility: All mathematical expressions are compatible within the same categorical framework\nEmpirical Grounding: Each definition specifies measurable phenomena and operational criteria\nTemporal Consistency: All definitions incorporate both synchronic and diachronic aspects appropriately\nProcessual Integration: The framework culminates in processual identity as the synthetic unification of all preceding concepts\n\nThis standardized approach ensures that each definition contributes to a coherent theoretical framework while maintaining empirical adequacy and formal rigor across philosophical metaphysics and philosophy of science[1][15].\n[1] https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/formal-methods-identity-philosophy [2] https://achinger.impan.pl/fac/fac.pdf [3] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.00447.pdf [4]

Building upon the philosophical foundations established in “On Identity: Ideas On Being & Becoming,” we develop formal definitions, axioms, and proofs that characterize identity as a contextually coherent process sustained by differential relations between intrinsic self-maintenance and extrinsic coupling. Our approach utilizes structured cospans to model the mediation between internal organization and external environment, while sheaf-theoretic methods capture the local-to-global coherence conditions necessary for identity persistence. We establish four fundamental theorems that provide the mathematical foundation for processual identity theory, with complete proofs demonstrating the consistency and empirical adequacy of our framework."

    "text": "Introduction\nThe question of what constitutes identity has challenged philosophers and scientists for millennia. Classical approaches have oscillated between substance-based theories, which ground identity in fixed essences, and purely relational theories, which dissolve identity into networks of relations[1]. Recent developments in category theory and sheaf theory offer new mathematical tools for understanding identity as a processual phenomenon that emerges from the dynamic interplay between internal organization and external coupling[2][3][4].\nThis article develops a formal mathematical framework for processual identity theory, grounded in the philosophical analysis presented in “On Identity: Ideas On Being & Becoming.” We establish rigorous definitions, axioms, and theorems that characterize identity as neither static substance nor mere relation, but as a contextually coherent process sustained by differential relations between intrinsic self-maintenance and extrinsic environmental coupling.\nOur approach utilizes three primary mathematical frameworks:\n\nStructured Cospans: To model the mediation between intrinsic invariants and extrinsic interactions[2][5][4]\nSheaf Theory: To capture local-to-global coherence conditions and contextual determination of identity[3][6][7]\nDifferential Topology: To formalize boundary formation and persistence conditions[8][9]"

    "text": "Main Theorems and Proofs\n\nTheorem 1 (Identity Persistence Theorem)\nStatement: For a system \\(S\\) with structured cospan \\(S \\to I \\leftarrow E\\), identity persists if and only if there exists a retract \\(r: E \\to I\\) such that \\(r \\circ S = \\text{id}_I\\).\nProof: Necessity: Assume identity persists. Then by definition, the system maintains its organizational invariants \\(I\\) despite environmental flux \\(E\\). This requires a mapping \\(r: E \\to I\\) that preserves the essential structure, i.e., \\(r \\circ S = \\text{id}_I\\).\nSufficiency: Assume such a retract \\(r\\) exists. Then for any environmental perturbation \\(e \\in E\\), we have \\(r(e) \\in I\\), ensuring that external influences are mapped back to intrinsic invariants. This guarantees persistence of identity.\nUniqueness: Suppose two retracts \\(r_1, r_2: E \\to I\\) exist. Then \\(r_1 \\circ S = r_2 \\circ S = \\text{id}_I\\). By the universal property of retracts in the category of structured cospans[2][5], we have \\(r_1 = r_2\\). \\(\\square\\)\n\n\nTheorem 2 (Sheaf Coherence Theorem)\nStatement: An identity sheaf \\(\\mathcal{I}_S\\) satisfies gluing conditions if and only if local properties cohere across overlapping contexts.\nProof: Forward Direction: Assume \\(\\mathcal{I}_S\\) satisfies gluing conditions. Let \\(\\{U_i\\}\\) be an open cover of \\(U\\) with compatible sections \\(s_i \\in \\mathcal{I}_S(U_i)\\). By the gluing axiom, there exists a unique global section \\(s \\in \\mathcal{I}_S(U)\\) such that \\(s|_{U_i} = s_i\\). This demonstrates local-to-global coherence.\nReverse Direction: Assume local properties cohere. We must show the existence and uniqueness of global sections. For existence, the coherence condition ensures that compatible local sections can be consistently extended. For uniqueness, suppose two global sections \\(s, s'\\) exist with \\(s|_{U_i} = s'|_{U_i} = s_i\\). By sheaf axiom and local determination, \\(s = s'\\). \\(\\square\\)\n\n\nTheorem 3 (Boundary Formation Theorem)\nStatement: A boundary \\(\\partial S\\) exists as a phase-state mediator if and only if the system exhibits selective permeability.\nProof: Existence: Selective permeability implies the existence of a function \\(\\phi(S, E)\\) measuring interaction strength. The boundary is then defined by the integral \\(\\partial S = \\int_{\\mathcal{E}} \\phi(S, E) \\, dE\\). By standard measure theory, this integral exists when \\(\\phi\\) is measurable and the environment space \\(\\mathcal{E}\\) has finite measure.\nUniqueness: The boundary is uniquely determined by the permeability function \\(\\phi\\), which in turn is determined by the system’s intrinsic organization and environmental coupling.\nPhase-State Mediation: The boundary mediates between internal phase separation and external interaction by filtering environmental influences according to the permeability function. \\(\\square\\)\n\n\nTheorem 4 (Processual Emergence Theorem)\nStatement: Identity emerges from the tension between internal phase separation and external interaction as: \\[\\text{Identity} = \\lim_{\\to} (\\text{Internal Phase Separation}) \\times \\lim_{\\leftarrow} (\\text{External Interaction})\\]\nProof: Limit Existence: Internal phase separation forms a direct system \\((I_\\alpha, f_{\\alpha\\beta})\\) of organizational patterns, while external interaction forms an inverse system \\((E_\\alpha, g_{\\alpha\\beta})\\) of environmental couplings. Both limits exist by the completeness of the respective categories.\nTension Dynamics: The product \\(\\lim_{\\to} I_\\alpha \\times \\lim_{\\leftarrow} E_\\alpha\\) captures the dynamic tension between maintaining internal coherence and allowing external adaptation.\nEmergence Conditions: Identity emerges when this product stabilizes, i.e., when the tension between internal and external forces reaches a dynamic equilibrium. This occurs precisely when the structured cospan mediating between intrinsic and extrinsic domains admits a retract as in Theorem 1. \\(\\square\\)"

The intrinsic domain \\(i\\) corresponds to the invariant measure, while the extrinsic domain \\(e\\) corresponds to the variable measure.

    "text": "Conclusion\nWe have presented a rigorous mathematical framework for processual identity theory, grounded in category theory and sheaf theory. Our four fundamental theorems establish the mathematical foundations for understanding identity as a contextually coherent process sustained by differential relations between intrinsic self-maintenance and extrinsic coupling.\nThe framework resolves classical philosophical puzzles about identity by providing precise mathematical conditions for persistence, coherence, and emergence. It offers empirically adequate formalisms for understanding identity across multiple domains, from biological systems to social institutions.\nThis work opens new avenues for research in mathematical philosophy, applied category theory, and the formal sciences. By providing rigorous mathematical foundations for processual identity, we contribute to the broader project of developing formal frameworks for understanding complex, dynamic systems that maintain coherence while adapting to environmental change."

Ubiquitous, yet puzzling, we seem to lack a formal, and measurable expressions of this relationality aspect of reality, not just how specific things relate in particular contexts, but what relation expresses. Nature seems to choose relation, rather than isolation, as the rule, but why?\n\n\nDefinition: Relationality in this context refers to the structured capacity for interaction, encompassing physical, informational, and causal connections across different domains and scales. Encompasses not only direct physical interactions (e.g., chemical bonds) but also informational (e.g., signaling networks), causal (e.g., feedback loops), and even abstract relationships (e.g., analogies across scientific domains).\nContemporary scientific and philosophical frameworks predominantly adopt what Whitehead (1978) termed a “substance ontology”. The implication is that things exist and therefore they may / will relate, whereas the reverse, when relationships are not secondary but primordial, things exist because relation allows the becoming of things into other things and so on. The substance-focused approach has led to significant advances in understanding component properties but could it also carry blind spots in our understanding of domain specific observations and their descriptions, and how they relate to others descriptions across scales?\n\n\n\nThe analytical reductionism that characterizes much of modern science has been said to fragment our understanding (refs to insert), making it difficult to address with rigour ecological concerns at a planetary scale. As Levin argues that inadequate frameworks for understanding relations across scales can limit our governance structures and ethical reasoning about complex systems (Levin (2021)).\nAiming at the inadequacy, it seems that pursuing a bigger picture towards filling this relational-deficit in our perception of reality, does not loom as a mere theoretical curiosity, as the findings may later be expressed usefully in practical resolutions when addressing scales outside of our perceptual range. Even at our scale, we could benefit from those explanations, as our governance practices treat systems separately, and our techno-economical-infrastructural-systems is anchored in narrow proxies (GDP, profit) which are used for accessing system-wide health states, and drive the scaling factors without any tangible and embedded understanding of how things relate from a temporal-causal perspective, neglecting both types of scales, the ones that concern us directly and those beyond our understanding (Holland (1992)) (Debra P. C. Peters and Havstad (2024)). While ignorance is not in scope of this article, as small note on intelligence that echoes the relational-deficit while broadening our field of concern, as Levin (2023) writes, “In fact, all intelligence is collective intelligence—not just termite mounds and beehives. We too are emergent beings supervening on a collection of cells which all were once independent unicellular organisms. How do they work together to enable the creation of a novel being with goals and memories that belong to it and not to any of its parts?”.\n figure source\nSome intriguing system properties such as nonlinearity, feedback loops, self-organisation are said to arise from the relationships among components, not from the properties of the components themselves Debra P. C. Peters and Havstad (2024). Systems are often nested Kauffman (1993), Simons (2006), Holland (1992), with each level of organization Atlan (2006) (cells, organs, organisms, societies) being itself a complex system composed of smaller interacting parts illustrate well the challenge of cross-scale mapping/tracking of events. Relational reasoning Gentner, Holyoak, and Kokinov (2001), Halford, Wilson, and Phillips (2010), as the ability to detect similarities and differences in patterns among objects, concepts, and situations, has been stated to be a basic cognitive mechanism that supports understanding of phenomena at both familiar and extreme scales. This suggests that the conceptual resources humans use to reason about small numbers or short time intervals are recycled, in an analogous fashion, to reason about much larger or smaller scales Alexandra Davatzes 2 & Nora S. Newcombe 3 & Thomas F. Shipley3 (2016). However, aligning reasoning across such disparate scales is not trivial: it often requires analogies, progressive alignment, and explicit scaffolding to bridge cognitive gaps Alexandra Davatzes 2 & Nora S. Newcombe 3 & Thomas F. Shipley3 (2016). Luckily, or due to human ingenuity we do seem equipt with some tools to deal with data at a large scale enhancing our human capabilities, and thus have acquired experimental data suggesting that networks of any kind display regular, scale-invariant features, with patterns that persist regardless of the absolute size or level of the system Yara Khaluf and Huepe."

Encompasses not only direct physical interactions (e.g., chemical bonds) but also informational (e.g., signaling networks), causal (e.g., feedback loops), and even abstract relationships (e.g., analogies across scientific domains).\nContemporary scientific and philosophical frameworks predominantly adopt what Whitehead (1978) termed a “substance ontology”. The implication is that things exist and therefore they may / will relate, whereas the reverse, when relationships are not secondary but primordial, things exist because relation allows the becoming of things into other things and so on. The substance-focused approach has led to significant advances in understanding component properties but could it also carry blind spots in our understanding of domain specific observations and their descriptions, and how they relate to others descriptions across scales?\n\n\n\nThe analytical reductionism that characterizes much of modern science has been said to fragment our understanding (refs to insert), making it difficult to address with rigour ecological concerns at a planetary scale. As Levin argues that inadequate frameworks for understanding relations across scales can limit our governance structures and ethical reasoning about complex systems (Levin (2021)).\nAiming at the inadequacy, it seems that pursuing a bigger picture towards filling this relational-deficit in our perception of reality, does not loom as a mere theoretical curiosity, as the findings may later be expressed usefully in practical resolutions when addressing scales outside of our perceptual range. Even at our scale, we could benefit from those explanations, as our governance practices treat systems separately, and our techno-economical-infrastructural-systems is anchored in narrow proxies (GDP, profit) which are used for accessing system-wide health states, and drive the scaling factors without any tangible and embedded understanding of how things relate from a temporal-causal perspective, neglecting both types of scales, the ones that concern us directly and those beyond our understanding (Holland (1992)) (Debra P. C. Peters and Havstad (2024)). While ignorance is not in scope of this article, as small note on intelligence that echoes the relational-deficit while broadening our field of concern, as Levin (2023) writes, “In fact, all intelligence is collective intelligence—not just termite mounds and beehives. We too are emergent beings supervening on a collection of cells which all were once independent unicellular organisms. How do they work together to enable the creation of a novel being with goals and memories that belong to it and not to any of its parts?”.\n figure source\nSome intriguing system properties such as nonlinearity, feedback loops, self-organisation are said to arise from the relationships among components, not from the properties of the components themselves Debra P. C. Peters and Havstad (2024). Systems are often nested Kauffman (1993), Simons (2006), Holland (1992), with each level of organization Atlan (2006) (cells, organs, organisms, societies) being itself a complex system composed of smaller interacting parts illustrate well the challenge of cross-scale mapping/tracking of events. Relational reasoning Gentner, Holyoak, and Kokinov (2001), Halford, Wilson, and Phillips (2010), as the ability to detect similarities and differences in patterns among objects, concepts, and situations, has been stated to be a basic cognitive mechanism that supports understanding of phenomena at both familiar and extreme scales. This suggests that the conceptual resources humans use to reason about small numbers or short time intervals are recycled, in an analogous fashion, to reason about much larger or smaller scales Alexandra Davatzes 2 & Nora S. Newcombe 3 & Thomas F. Shipley3 (2016). However, aligning reasoning across such disparate scales is not trivial: it often requires analogies, progressive alignment, and explicit scaffolding to bridge cognitive gaps Alexandra Davatzes 2 & Nora S. Newcombe 3 & Thomas F. Shipley3 (2016). Luckily, or due to human ingenuity we do seem equipt with some tools to deal with data at a large scale enhancing our human capabilities, and thus have acquired experimental data suggesting that networks of any kind display regular, scale-invariant features, with patterns that persist regardless of the absolute size or level of the system Yara Khaluf and Huepe."

    "text": "2 Theoretical Foundations: Towards a Relational Understanding\n\n2.1 Grounding a Relational View with Substance-Ontology?\nA relational view of the universe, grounded in the well-established tradition of substance ontology, has shaped much of scientific and philosophical inquiry for centuries. Substance1 ontology posits that reality is fundamentally composed of substances: entities that exist independently and possess properties or attributes 2 3. This point-of-view has provided us many foundational knowledge and methods for understanding the persistence of things, and how they change, from where we constructed identity scopes matching our language and signs for those things. Substance theory holds that substances are ontologically independent,they do not require anything else to exist. An intuition is that this rationale has influenced to some degree modern science and it’s technological advancements. While it makes sense that identity-persistence and degrees of independence are sound, for example, when tree remains a tree regardless of whether its leaves change color or fall, its substance (the underlying “tree-ness”) persists through change, which gives us a way to track identity over time, in this case the seasons. But what if instead of seasons, or the full cycle of becoming and perishing of a tree, we want to track causal chains systematically, “allowing-tree” or “allowing tree-ness”, and “allowed-from-tree-ness”? From a substance ontology perspective, the “becoming of” and “allowing for” have been out of scope, because the scope is “tree”. Here trees as objects are modeled as enduring entities subject to forces and interactions, and there it would be contradictory to say that substances are vehicles of those forces within their range of affectation. The point here is to recognize the useful bounds of this the substance-based view, which has supported the development of scientific laws and models by providing a stable ontology. For example, conservation laws (of mass, energy, momentum) presuppose the persistence of substances through transformation. The ability to individuate and classify entities (species, elements, particles) is grounded in the assumption that substances are discrete and stable Altuner (April 2013),\n1 In metaphysics, “substance” refers not merely to material stuff, but to any entity that can exist on its own and serve as the bearer of properties.2 Aristotle’s ontology, for example, makes substance the primary category: “Substance, since it has an independent existence, is the reason for being of all things”.3 hylomorphism, (from Greek hylē, “matter”; morphē, “form”), in philosophy, metaphysical view according to which every natural body consists of two intrinsic principles, one potential, namely, primary matter, and one actual, namely, substantial form. It was the central doctrine of Aristotle’s philosophy of nature. Before Aristotle, the Ionian philosophers had sought the basic constituents of bodies; but Aristotle observed that it was necessary to distinguish two types of principles.Today’s open questions and pressing challenges, may be difficult to address or attempt to explain solely in terms of isolated substances, but can we soundly treat change as a phenomena? The proposal is to create a theoretical space where we can look beyond taxonomies, while anchored in what we know, using conservation and physical laws, expanding the existing models of interaction, an if lucky challenge some assumptions and learn something new.\n\n\n2.2 From Objects to Relations: And Relations as Objects\nBeginning with Einstein’s relativity and continuing through quantum theory, physics has increasingly moved away from Newtonian notions of absolute space and time toward a panorama where relations between events define reality. Multiple research traditions have approached aspects of relationality, though often in domain-specific contexts, or closely related domains (bio-chem-physical).\nThe challenge, the pursuit of a general mathematical expression for relational dynamics resembles earlier unification efforts in physics, such as Maxwell’s equations unifying electricity and magnetism, or Einstein’s attempts to create a unified field theory. The difference is that a relational formalism would potentially treat phenomena across traditionally separate domains from a perspective of interactions as a manifestation of relation.\nEntertaining this perspective shift, from seeing relationships as properties of things to things emerging 4 from relationships, I wonder about this effect at a quantum scale. I say this timidly, but isn’t the established tha particles cannot be fully described independently of their interactions? There seems to be a worthy of pursuit opportunity here, to explore this parallel with the ecological stance where similarly, organisms cannot be fully described independently of their relationships their ecosystems.\n4 I don’t usually like the word “emergence” I ofter try to refrain from “trendy words” and polysemic terms without proper warning, however as a note for later, from a relational perspective emergence may be a stable pattern, even predictable, to some degree of course.Given my previous work (insert refs) where I proposed that the capacity to affect and be affected, the potential and means of interaction, as a currency of relational dynamics therefore taking terms as affordance from qualitative to quantitative domains, formalizing agency, as mathematical expression that integrate energy flows, morphological constraints, and orders of embedment, I’m expecting to establish from it a continuity in rationale, towards a quantifiable basis for understanding why and how things relate from a general perspective. The aspiration is that this may allow for an deeper understanding, and possible resolution of entanglement paradoxes via ecological interdependence, unearthing novel principles governing connection.\nWhen postulating three principles supporting the basis of this paradigm shift, based on experimental evidence, we had to look into constants and shared patterns showing scale invariance, after all, scale and context-dependent descriptions or how thing relate are varied and detailed. We also seem to require a revision of known paradoxes withing those domain-specific theories, for later analysis in shared resolutions. Furthermore we need to look for where relationships happen: inside and at the border of, implying that studies of how things take shape and make up other things should also. regardless of scale, not contradict the scale invariance patterns found, while simultaneously agreeing with what is known about the subjects in context."

    "text": "3 Methods: Measuring Relationships Across Scales\nHow can we further explore these vague requirements into the grounds of workable parameters? This effort however preliminary, aims for methods allowing direct comparison of relational dynamics from subject-independent framing.\nConsolidating the requirements and ideas from the previous section we have:\nA. Scale-Invariance: the mapping of a relational event from a smaller to a larger scale should be reflected through a power law, a pattern / sequence, or any other reasonable orderly quantity.\nB. Degrees of Relation: quantifying relations then must comprise spacial and temporal aspects of a thing while, holding it’s relation of becoming and allowing for, while at the same time reflect it’s relation when compared to some other thing.\nC. Relations as Causal-Inducers: from the quantities of relation, predictions of co-relation must be attempted and ofc should hold against known behaviours / observations.\nAn obvious phenomena (is energy exchange a phenomena?) is energy exchange in relational events. Energy, in its myriad forms, seems to serve as both the medium and message of interaction, across scales, offering measurable pathways to operationalise the exploratory working-parameters above (scale-invariance, degrees of relation, and causal induction). Yet, as Richard Feynman famously cautioned, while we can quantify energy, we do not fully grasp its essence. In his lectures, he likened energy to a child’s indestructible blocks: a conserved, abstract quantity that persists through transformations, even as its manifestations (kinetic, thermal, bioelectric) shift in form and context. As we may attempt to “count” the “blocks” meticulously in this postulate, we must remain humble.\nThe energy or things seems to dictate, shape, persistence and motion. Maupertuis’s 5 formulation suggesting that nature always acts in the most efficient way possible, using the least amount of “action” necessary to achieve a result, focusing on the optimization of a quantity (action) rather than on forces and velocities directly. When applying these concepts beyond physics, similar principles often need to be adapted or reinterpreted. For example, in economics or biology, the “action” might not be a direct measure of energy but could represent a different kind of “cost” or “effort” that is minimized 6. Evidently the exercise in question is to identify a quantity or binding principle that can be expressed to describe the behavior of the system in general. Where interactions as energy exchange-based events seem to be measurable, scale-invariant processes by which systems establish and maintain relationships through asymmetric potential gradients seem far more challenging to reconcile. While the nature of energy eludes definition, its role as a conserved, scale-invariant mediator of interaction seem empirically solid, if we dare, operating as both:\n5 Pierre Louis Maupertuis was a French mathematician, philosopher, and astronomer.6 Such metrics could inform what we call “planetary agreements”, governance frameworks that explicitly recognize the relational nature of human: Earth systems and establish parameters for maintaining beneficial relationships across scales.A. Medium: The “currency” of interaction (e.g., photons, ATP, gravitational waves).\nB. Message: Encodes relational information (e.g., voltage patterns guiding morphogenesis, cosmic web filaments encoding dark matter flows)."

    "text": "4 Conclusion: The Path Forward\nHere we have presented some preliminary ideas for further understanding relationships across domains and scales preceding the actual postulate of “The Relational Universe”. The preliminary ideas stand of the argument that relationships if seen as the primary reality from which entities emerge as stable patterns, do not imply a substitution nor invalidate the substance-ontology perspective, but may extend in means and range our current knowledge landscape. Rooted in the expectation that this perspective shift may even opens new approaches to longstanding questions across disciplines, from the nature of complexity to the origins of intelligence, and from planetary governance to ethics, the motivation holds a desire for developing formal expression allowing measurements and predictions of how things relate in general terms without contradicting existing domain specific knowledge. The path forward seems deceptively simple: it requires formalising the how and the why of interaction, and with open mind and childlike curiosity I’ll proceed.\nIn a universe where everything relates, understanding the nature and dynamics of these relationships becomes not just an intellectual pursuit but a practical necessity. The relational perspective invites us (it has invited me, and therefore by extension you) to see ourselves not as isolated entities but as nodes in a web so vast, our perception may have tricked us to ignore the depth and breath of this cosmic conversation that preceded us and will continue long after we’re gone.\n\n4.1 References\n\n\nAlexandra Davatzes 2 & Nora S.

From the very small to the very large, from particles to planets, molecules to minds, things seem to exists in relation to other things, while at the same time, knowingly or not, they hold a relationship with themselves as well. Nothing seems to exists in isolation; thus the intuition is that relation itself appears to be something of the fundamental type. As such, this paper aims to express and articulate some supporting ideas for working parameters, prior to attempting a postulate for a relational universe hypothesis. Naturally a multidisciplinary effort, this avant-propos requires identifying recurring patterns, from which some candidate relational principles are then proposed, stemming from the perspective shift where interactions may be posed as ontologically primary, yet having a substance-ontology-informed basis, allowing things beyond their traditional classification scope, where substances morph and evolve, through higher-order relationships. This constructive inversion of focus, from substance to relation seems to raise profound and apposite questions in our understanding of the universe, and our place in it. \n\n\n\n\n\nJun 20, 2025\n\n\n12 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "In the world of things, nothing can be a part of itself, or so it is said. Regardless of how perception of signs and the intricate processes of symbolic attribution, in order to interpret to interpret and materialize them ivia structured categorisation and classification of things such as a cell, a cell is a cell via its membrane. No membrane, no cell. There is no contradiction, as the cell cannot be and not be simultaneously. But if we call it “kgkds” instead of a cell, and attribute it to the same object, it would not change the fact that the object in question requires an identity to persist, and that part of that identity is its own morphological description. This, partially agrees with Aristotelians and partially disagrees with positivists who argue that contradictions in nature result from linguistic or cognitive errors given by our perceptual limitations. A proposal is that scale and perspective at scale is where the issue resides. Moreover, paradoxes such as Who shaves the barber, and Does infinity contain itself or not? are familiar and I’m curious as to which methods we could use to test a hypothesis where in both cases, for the barber and the infinity, they are a boundary, a formal interface to something else much like the cell or the reference object “kgkds”. If we make a clear distinction between belonging (cell belonging to tissue) and composing (morphisms of atoms and molecules into cells), and allow specification and regularity (set/subset - blocking self membership Zermelo-Fraenkel) atoms compose and belong to cells simultaneously and there is no contradiction because they refer (belonging / composition) to different levels of abstraction (hierarchical description composition &lt; belonging). There are several aspects of interest here: The first one is self-reference as a reusable pattern in nature, which should be allowed because it is observed, but in either case (allowed / not allowed) a sound explanation should exist. The second is, in the case of infinity, what does this pose?\nWhile hierarchical boundaries could in principle resolve logical contradictions by enforcing scale-dependent distinctions between composition (parts forming a whole) and membership (elements belonging to a set), this seems rather profound, nearing questions much greater than what I originally thought of.\n\n\nA cell’s membrane defines its identity by separating it from what’s not a cell. Without this boundary, the cell dissolves into its environment. The law of identity \\((A = A)\\) and as some logical positivist, points to how contradictions arise only when boundaries (physical or conceptual) are ambiguously defined.\nAt the atomic level, the cell is a dynamic composition of molecules; at the tissue level, it’s a functional unit. Contradictions vanish when distinctions between belonging (cell ∈ tissue) and composing (atoms → molecules → organelles → cell) are maintained across hierarchical scales. Russell’s paradox (does the set of all sets that don’t contain themselves contain itself?) arises from self-membership. Similarly, the “barber paradox” exposes inconsistencies in self-referential definitions. By banning self-membership (via the axiom of regularity), ZF set theory treats sets as hierarchical containers. A set cannot belong to itself, just as a cell’s membrane prevents it from being its own environment.\nIn the “kgkds” example I used earlier, I attempted a humorous provocation to show that in this context identity depends on structural interfaces (e.g., membranes, mathematical axioms) rather than labels; it does not matter what we call this object, allowing us to introduce a certain secure abstraction and tangibility hereafter.\nThe implications are that self-reference and infinity are paradoxic inducers only when objects in scope are treated as monolithic symbols rather than nested but well defined interfaces.\nTheoretically, by distinguishing belonging (membership) from composing (structure), and embracing scale-dependent perspectives, ww could in principle model nature without logical inconsistency. Self-reference, scale-dependent perspectives, and paradoxes like Russell’s, could just be ambiguous descriptions that dissolve under hierarchical structuring.\nBut can the axioms of regularity, cumulative hierarchies, and category theory be used to show / proof how systems avoid logical inconsistency through stratified organization?\nIf we let \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) denote a hierarchical system with scales indexed by ordinals \\(\\alpha\\), then at each scale, we have lower-scale entities as composition: \\[\n\\begin{CD}\nx_\\beta @&gt;\\text{Comp}_\\alpha&gt;&gt; X_\\alpha @&gt;\\text{Mem}_\\alpha&gt;&gt; \\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha+1} \\\\\n@V\\partial_\\beta VV @V\\partial_\\alpha VV @V\\partial_{\\alpha+1}VV \\\\\nV_\\beta @&gt;\\subseteq&gt;&gt; V_\\alpha @&gt;\\subseteq&gt;&gt; V_{\\alpha+1}\n\\end{CD}\n\\]\nWhich commutatively, \\(\\partial_\\alpha \\circ \\text{Comp}_\\alpha = \\text{Comp}_\\alpha \\circ \\partial_\\beta\\) ensure boundaries propagate upward, with no self-membership, as the vertical \\(\\partial\\)-arrows enforce \\(X_\\alpha \\notin X_\\alpha\\), as \\(X_\\alpha \\subseteq V_\\alpha\\) but \\(X_\\alpha \\in V_{\\alpha+1}\\).\nAnd if we let \\(R = \\{ X \\mid X \\notin X \\}\\), under hierarchical boundaries, the resolution \\(R\\) is demoted to a proper class because \\(\\text{rank}(R) = \\sup_{X \\in R} (\\text{rank}(X) + 1)\\), which is not an ordinal in ZF, and as such \\(R \\notin V_\\alpha\\) for any \\(\\alpha\\), avoiding \\(R \\in R \\iff R \\notin R\\).\nFor a “cell” \\(C\\), \\(C = \\text{Comp}(\\text{atoms}) \\subseteq V_{\\alpha}\\), which for both composition, and membership we have \\(C \\in \\text{Tissue} \\subseteq V_{\\alpha+1}\\).\nHere, the rank inequality, \\(\\text{rank}(\\text{atoms}) &lt; \\text{rank}(C) &lt; \\text{rank}(\\text{Tissue})\\), eliminates ambiguity.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor any system \\[ S \\], its boundary \\[ \\partial S \\] is defined by interaction capacity:\n\\[  \n\\partial S = \\{ x \\,|\\, \\forall y (y \\prec x \\rightarrow y \\prec_{\\text{int}} S) \\}  \n\\]\nwhere \\[ \\prec_{\\text{int}} \\] denotes “interacts with.” A cell’s membrane, for instance, defines \\[ \\partial S \\] via ion channel selectivity.\n\n\n\nRussell’s paradox (\\[ R = \\{ X | X \\notin X \\} \\]) dissolves under ZF set theory’s axiom of regularity, which enforces:\n\\[  \n\\forall S \\, \\exists \\alpha \\, \\left( \\partial_\\alpha(S) \\neq \\emptyset \\implies \\text{rank}(S) = \\alpha \\land S \\notin V_\\beta \\text{ for } \\beta \\leq \\alpha \\right)  \n\\]\nThis ensures:\n- Atoms compose cells (\\[ \\text{rank}(\\text{atoms}) &lt; \\text{rank}(\\text{cell}) \\])\n- Cells belong to tissues (\\[ \\text{cell} \\in V_{\\alpha+1} \\])\nHere no system contains itself as a safeguard against contradiction.\n\n\n\n\nFor the hierarchical system \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) with scales indexed by ordinals \\(\\alpha\\), then at each scale, we have lower-scale entities as composition:\n\\[\n\\begin{CD}\nx_\\beta @&gt;\\text{Comp}_\\alpha&gt;&gt; X_\\alpha @&gt;\\text{Mem}_\\alpha&gt;&gt; \\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha+1} \\\\\n@V\\partial_\\beta VV @V\\partial_\\alpha VV @V\\partial_{\\alpha+1}VV \\\\\nV_\\beta @&gt;\\subseteq&gt;&gt; V_\\alpha @&gt;\\subseteq&gt;&gt; V_{\\alpha+1}\n\\end{CD}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\forall S \\, \\exists \\alpha \\, \\left( \\partial_\\alpha(S) \\neq \\emptyset \\implies \\text{rank}(S) = \\alpha \\land \\neg \\exists \\beta \\leq \\alpha \\, (S \\in V_\\beta) \\right)}\n\\]\n\nWhere in \\(\\boxed{\\forall S \\, \\exists \\alpha \\, \\left( \\partial_\\alpha(S) \\neq \\emptyset \\right)}\\) : The existence of a boundary \\(\\partial_\\alpha(S)\\) implies \\(S\\) is constrained to rank \\(\\alpha\\).\n\nAnd in \\(\\boxed{\\text{rank}(S) = \\alpha \\land \\neg \\exists \\beta \\leq \\alpha \\, (S \\in V_\\beta)}\\) : The rank ensures \\(S\\) cannot self-belong or compose itself at any lower scale \\(\\beta \\leq \\alpha\\).\n\n\n\n\nThe question if this is informing us of a fundamental design principle in nature requires humility. It seems sound to say that hierarchical boundaries resolve contradictions by enforcing scale-dependent distinctions. But is objectionable from epistemic and quantum limits. Perhaps the assumption that nature’s apparent non-contradiction arises not from human logic, but from boundary-defined strata that approximate reality’s complexity. An inconsistency also seems apparent when treating scale separation as intrinsic to nature, because if theories succeed at describing gravity according to to quantum mechanics, the implication that space-time may be discrete at Planck scales blurs hierarchical distinctions. Yet, another point of contentions is the paradox resolve of infinity through proper classes, because for the case of an absolute infinity (canto’r) which is said to transcends all hierarchies, it implies a contradiction at the meta-level.\nSo, the following \\[Things=∑∂(boundaries)\\] does not hold, because hierarchy may break down.\nMaybe just relativity enforces \\(c\\) as a cosmic speed limit, hierarchical boundaries act as logical speed limits, preventing contradictions, and the rank function \\(rank(S)\\) may be seen as analogous to spacetime intervals, invariant across frames (scales). At Planck scales, the hierarchy may break down, but emergent boundaries (e.g., decoherence) restore classicality. Thus, boundaries are effective, not fundamental, and hierarchy can be better seen as a map, and not the territory, although a useful map in understanding.\nI care about abstraction-layers because logical levels of abstraction, and clarity in abstraction requires discipline in separation, allowing for higher-order relational reasoning, which in turn allows us to manipulate symbols pointing to large structures of knowledge and things, for sense-making at scale. If we take notions of composition and belonging those are not the same. They express distinct levels of of abstraction, where composition is to a lower-level of abstraction, and belonging a higher-level one. Interfaces as structured boundaries that enforce non-circular interaction, resolving paradoxes and enable scalable complexity without conflating identities. Here by identity I’m expressing a sort of coherence, a persistence, one that does not avoid completely environmental interactions, but one that allows for coherence.\nWhile hierarchical boundaries resolve contradictions by enforcing scale-dependent distinctions as an effective tool. However I must confess to be confused because, quantum coherence expresses phase relationships between waves the ones that, together, describe an object. Then boundaries are coherence-preserving tools via interactions (decoherence), while also phase-relationships between waves, better put stabilized phase relationships?\nIf so, a workaround for it not to invalidate the boundary problem at the Planck scale is by having decoherence restoring effective boundaries at larger scales by averaging out Planck-scale chaos.\nIf at a quantum level decoherence means the loss of identity (dissolves quantum superposition), into a new identity (into classical definiteness) then at the collapsing superpositions, decoherence creates stable classical identities (a cell as alive, a set as rank-α).\nFrom a classic point of view decoherence allow for identity then what does coherence do?\nAlso, if a cell’s membrane is no more “real” than a qubit’s coherence, given that both are stable patterns, a description of nature’s strata that succeeds not by mirroring reality, but by description, what are interactions? Are they more or less real that substances (particles, cells, sets) that we perceive as distinct entities?\nIf we put as \\[Things=∑∂(interactions)\\] where boundaries are fruit by interactions, then what allows interaction? And if the hierarchical boundaries don’t hold between quantum and classical mechanics, but as mere effective negotiations through interaction density and scale, what can be the nature of this negotiation be?\nCould it be so that from a relational-ontology perspective, interactions are some kind of fundamental means of reality, while boundaries are the habits of reality? Stable interaction patterns that enable prediction and coherence while decoherence negotiates quantum-classical transitions by filtering noise, much like a cell membrane filters toxins?\nCan the hierarchical boundary axiom \\[\\boxed{\\forall S \\, \\exists \\alpha \\, \\left( \\partial_\\alpha(S) \\neq \\emptyset \\implies \\text{rank}(S) = \\alpha \\land \\neg \\exists \\beta \\leq \\alpha \\, (S \\in V_\\beta) \\right)}\\] and formalising interaction summation making up reality \\[Things=∑∂(interactions)\\] mean anything at all beyond formal insights?"

The law of identity \\((A = A)\\) and as some logical positivist, points to how contradictions arise only when boundaries (physical or conceptual) are ambiguously defined.\nAt the atomic level, the cell is a dynamic composition of molecules; at the tissue level, it’s a functional unit. Contradictions vanish when distinctions between belonging (cell ∈ tissue) and composing (atoms → molecules → organelles → cell) are maintained across hierarchical scales. Russell’s paradox (does the set of all sets that don’t contain themselves contain itself?) arises from self-membership. Similarly, the “barber paradox” exposes inconsistencies in self-referential definitions. By banning self-membership (via the axiom of regularity), ZF set theory treats sets as hierarchical containers. A set cannot belong to itself, just as a cell’s membrane prevents it from being its own environment.\nIn the “kgkds” example I used earlier, I attempted a humorous provocation to show that in this context identity depends on structural interfaces (e.g., membranes, mathematical axioms) rather than labels; it does not matter what we call this object, allowing us to introduce a certain secure abstraction and tangibility hereafter.\nThe implications are that self-reference and infinity are paradoxic inducers only when objects in scope are treated as monolithic symbols rather than nested but well defined interfaces.\nTheoretically, by distinguishing belonging (membership) from composing (structure), and embracing scale-dependent perspectives, ww could in principle model nature without logical inconsistency. Self-reference, scale-dependent perspectives, and paradoxes like Russell’s, could just be ambiguous descriptions that dissolve under hierarchical structuring.\nBut can the axioms of regularity, cumulative hierarchies, and category theory be used to show / proof how systems avoid logical inconsistency through stratified organization?\nIf we let \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) denote a hierarchical system with scales indexed by ordinals \\(\\alpha\\), then at each scale, we have lower-scale entities as composition: \\[\n\\begin{CD}\nx_\\beta @&gt;\\text{Comp}_\\alpha&gt;&gt; X_\\alpha @&gt;\\text{Mem}_\\alpha&gt;&gt; \\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha+1} \\\\\n@V\\partial_\\beta VV @V\\partial_\\alpha VV @V\\partial_{\\alpha+1}VV \\\\\nV_\\beta @&gt;\\subseteq&gt;&gt; V_\\alpha @&gt;\\subseteq&gt;&gt; V_{\\alpha+1}\n\\end{CD}\n\\]\nWhich commutatively, \\(\\partial_\\alpha \\circ \\text{Comp}_\\alpha = \\text{Comp}_\\alpha \\circ \\partial_\\beta\\) ensure boundaries propagate upward, with no self-membership, as the vertical \\(\\partial\\)-arrows enforce \\(X_\\alpha \\notin X_\\alpha\\), as \\(X_\\alpha \\subseteq V_\\alpha\\) but \\(X_\\alpha \\in V_{\\alpha+1}\\).\nAnd if we let \\(R = \\{ X \\mid X \\notin X \\}\\), under hierarchical boundaries, the resolution \\(R\\) is demoted to a proper class because \\(\\text{rank}(R) = \\sup_{X \\in R} (\\text{rank}(X) + 1)\\), which is not an ordinal in ZF, and as such \\(R \\notin V_\\alpha\\) for any \\(\\alpha\\), avoiding \\(R \\in R \\iff R \\notin R\\).\nFor a “cell” \\(C\\), \\(C = \\text{Comp}(\\text{atoms}) \\subseteq V_{\\alpha}\\), which for both composition, and membership we have \\(C \\in \\text{Tissue} \\subseteq V_{\\alpha+1}\\).\nHere, the rank inequality, \\(\\text{rank}(\\text{atoms}) &lt; \\text{rank}(C) &lt; \\text{rank}(\\text{Tissue})\\), eliminates ambiguity."

    "text": "The question if this is informing us of a fundamental design principle in nature requires humility. It seems sound to say that hierarchical boundaries resolve contradictions by enforcing scale-dependent distinctions. But is objectionable from epistemic and quantum limits. Perhaps the assumption that nature’s apparent non-contradiction arises not from human logic, but from boundary-defined strata that approximate reality’s complexity. An inconsistency also seems apparent when treating scale separation as intrinsic to nature, because if theories succeed at describing gravity according to to quantum mechanics, the implication that space-time may be discrete at Planck scales blurs hierarchical distinctions. Yet, another point of contentions is the paradox resolve of infinity through proper classes, because for the case of an absolute infinity (canto’r) which is said to transcends all hierarchies, it implies a contradiction at the meta-level.\nSo, the following \\[Things=∑∂(boundaries)\\] does not hold, because hierarchy may break down.\nMaybe just relativity enforces \\(c\\) as a cosmic speed limit, hierarchical boundaries act as logical speed limits, preventing contradictions, and the rank function \\(rank(S)\\) may be seen as analogous to spacetime intervals, invariant across frames (scales). At Planck scales, the hierarchy may break down, but emergent boundaries (e.g., decoherence) restore classicality. Thus, boundaries are effective, not fundamental, and hierarchy can be better seen as a map, and not the territory, although a useful map in understanding.\nI care about abstraction-layers because logical levels of abstraction, and clarity in abstraction requires discipline in separation, allowing for higher-order relational reasoning, which in turn allows us to manipulate symbols pointing to large structures of knowledge and things, for sense-making at scale. If we take notions of composition and belonging those are not the same. They express distinct levels of of abstraction, where composition is to a lower-level of abstraction, and belonging a higher-level one. Interfaces as structured boundaries that enforce non-circular interaction, resolving paradoxes and enable scalable complexity without conflating identities. Here by identity I’m expressing a sort of coherence, a persistence, one that does not avoid completely environmental interactions, but one that allows for coherence.\nWhile hierarchical boundaries resolve contradictions by enforcing scale-dependent distinctions as an effective tool. However I must confess to be confused because, quantum coherence expresses phase relationships between waves the ones that, together, describe an object. Then boundaries are coherence-preserving tools via interactions (decoherence), while also phase-relationships between waves, better put stabilized phase relationships?\nIf so, a workaround for it not to invalidate the boundary problem at the Planck scale is by having decoherence restoring effective boundaries at larger scales by averaging out Planck-scale chaos.\nIf at a quantum level decoherence means the loss of identity (dissolves quantum superposition), into a new identity (into classical definiteness) then at the collapsing superpositions, decoherence creates stable classical identities (a cell as alive, a set as rank-α).\nFrom a classic point of view decoherence allow for identity then what does coherence do?\nAlso, if a cell’s membrane is no more “real” than a qubit’s coherence, given that both are stable patterns, a description of nature’s strata that succeeds not by mirroring reality, but by description, what are interactions? Are they more or less real that substances (particles, cells, sets) that we perceive as distinct entities?\nIf we put as \\[Things=∑∂(interactions)\\] where boundaries are fruit by interactions, then what allows interaction? And if the hierarchical boundaries don’t hold between quantum and classical mechanics, but as mere effective negotiations through interaction density and scale, what can be the nature of this negotiation be?\nCould it be so that from a relational-ontology perspective, interactions are some kind of fundamental means of reality, while boundaries are the habits of reality? Stable interaction patterns that enable prediction and coherence while decoherence negotiates quantum-classical transitions by filtering noise, much like a cell membrane filters toxins?\nCan the hierarchical boundary axiom \\[\\boxed{\\forall S \\, \\exists \\alpha \\, \\left( \\partial_\\alpha(S) \\neq \\emptyset \\implies \\text{rank}(S) = \\alpha \\land \\neg \\exists \\beta \\leq \\alpha \\, (S \\in V_\\beta) \\right)}\\] and formalising interaction summation making up reality \\[Things=∑∂(interactions)\\] mean anything at all beyond formal insights?"

    "text": "In earlier papers concerning boundaries, I explored if they could be rendered contradiction-free by enforcing hierarchical distinctions: composition versus membership, part versus whole, each neatly separated by a rank axiom. The cell’s membrane, used as an example of a static interface, a necessary wall between self and other, with hierarchy as the ultimate safeguard against paradox. While question on the nature of identity 1, it occurred to me, that my some of the previous notes on boundaries had limitations that contradicted some of the insights gathered in the process of formalise identity. Previously I was looking at boundaries as interfaces, and attempted to formalise without fully capturing their dynamism. Perhaps framing them even as absolute partitions, without full acknowledgement of the the cases where they appear fuzzy, such as clouds, where boundaries become contextual, dynamic, and co-constitutively embedded in their niches, that may not be reflected in the past approaches grounded in rank-theoretic axioms, and symmetric adjunctions.\n1 “On Identity: Ideas On Being & Becoming”By treating boundaries as static interfaces between pre-existing entities rather than as processual co-constitutive dynamics as explored in the Identity paper, the hierarchical axiom \\[\n\\text{rank}(x)&lt;\\text{rank}(y) \\implies x \\notin y\n\\]\npresupposes that entities possess determinate ranks independently of their relational contexts, when in fact both entities and their organizational levels may be given through boundary interactions themselves. This was of course mentioned throughout the Boundary series papers, however the formulation need a revision. The identity paper’s insight that existence is relational becoming rather than substantial being exposes this fundamental category error.\nMathematically, my reliance on ZF set theory and rank functions reflects what sheaf theorists recognize as the inadequacy of classical foundations for capturing contextual relationships (Chen and Harris 2025). The identity paper’s sheaf formulation\n\\[\n\\mathcal{I}_S(U) = \\{\\text{Properties of } S \\text{ observable in context } U\\}\n\\]\nreveals that boundaries are sections of sheaves, locally defined but globally coherent structures, rather than absolute separators between ranked sets.\nMy mistake was fruit of ignorance, I came across the realisation that set-theoretic approaches assume that membership relations (\\(x \\in y\\)) are context-independent, but biological and social systems demonstrate that part-whole relationships are fundamentally contextual(boundaries-2?). A mitochondrion “belongs to” a cell in metabolic contexts but “composes” tissue in developmental contexts, relationships that sheaf theory captures through its gluing conditions but that rank hierarchies cannot accommodate.\nThe experimental validation in Boundaries III sought universal convergence thresholds (\\(\\lambda \\approx 0.9957\\)) across biological systems, and in the bioelectric experiments I conducted, measuring scaling laws in Xenopus tissue and slime mold networks, actually demonstrate contextual boundary formation rather than universal constants (Levin 2019; Chao, Fakhreddin, and Shimerov 2014).\nThe identity paper’s core insight, that identity emerges through structured cospans \\(S \\to I \\leftarrow E\\) where intrinsic invariants (\\(I\\)) maintain stability amid extrinsic flux (\\(E\\)), seems to somewhat challenges the boundary hypothesis symmetric assumptions. The retract condition \\(r: E \\to I\\) may better capture how environmental pressures asymmetrically constitute boundaries while preserving internal coherence, a dynamic that my previous symmetric adjunctions \\(B_S \\dashv R_S\\) completely missed.\nCritically, the identity paper’s temporal formulation \\[\n\\text{Id}(X) = \\lim_{\\rightarrow \\text{interactions}} X_t\n\\] may better express boundaries as temporal attractors rather than spatial demarcations (Nimbalkar 2024).\nMore tangibly, Boundaries I explores the interface axiom but failed to recognize that interfaces are co-constituted rather than mediating. It is expressed in verbatim, however in Boundaries II the developed hierarchical rank functions impose artificial separations on what may be naturally continuous processes. Then, in Boundaries III, it is provided experimental validation of a shared transaction via scaling factor for bioelectric-patterns, that require a careful consideration to test this contextual variability require in case of sheaf-theoretic interpretation. In each paper it is proposed that fomalising boundaries could solve paradoxes, achieved by separating conflicting domains, and the operators for such separation did not express the tension, or asymmetry through which interactions occur, which in case of a cell’s membrane, the asymmetry in voltage potentials seems to be what confers its identity as a cell. In this light, self-referential paradoxes may dissolves not through rank separation, which is incomplete, but through contextual restriction of self-membership domains, which a sheaf-theoretic approach expresses better than the hierarchical solution.\nHere, we’ll attempt to reconstruct the boundary theory through three revisions:\n- First: replacing hierarchical axioms with sheaf gluing conditions to capture contextual coherence,\n- Second: incorporating asymmetric structured cospans as an attempt to re-formalize the dynamics in boundary formation\n- Third: redesigning experiments to incorporate the temporal attractors and relational scaling\n\n\n\n\nThe original hierarchical axiom \\(\\text{rank}(x) &lt; \\text{rank}(y) \\implies x \\notin y\\) fails to capture part-whole relationships which are context-dependent.

The “truth bubbles” of apparent goal-directedness may simply reflect the elegant mathematics underlying efficient algorithms. True morphogenetic analysis requires distinguishing between mechanical optimization and genuine biological-style intelligence—a distinction that remains tantalizingly elusive in our digital age.\n“Sometimes the most intelligent thing an algorithm can do is admit it might just be following instructions very, very well.”heme: cosmo"

By applying the methodology from Zhang et al.’s “Classical Sorting Algorithms as a Model of Morphogenesis” (2401.05375v1) to our MSD radix sort implementation, we can examine whether bitwise decision-making creates emergent developmental patterns.\nThis analysis explores the “truth bubbles” concept—the idea that local bitwise operations (truth table evaluations) aggregate into global organizational structures, much like how local cellular interactions drive morphogenesis in biology."

They enable the fundamental paradox of existence: being distinct while remaining connected, maintaining identity while enabling change.\nFrom bioelectric morphogenesis to social network dynamics, the same pattern emerges: sustainable systems require boundaries that are neither too rigid nor too fluid, but dynamically responsive to context while maintaining structural invariants. The mathematics of adjoint functors formalizes this insight: boundaries and relations are dual aspects of a single relational process.\nThe cell membrane teaches us the deepest lesson: to be is to interface. To persist is to maintain selective permeability. To grow is to renegotiate the boundary between self and world, preserving what matters while adapting to what changes.\nIn the next paper, we will explore how these boundary dynamics give rise to relations themselves—how the universal patterns of interface negotiation create the syntactic structures through which entities at every scale compose into larger wholes.\nTowards a Logic of Mediation\n\n\n0.5.1 Boundary Functors\nIn category theory, boundaries and relations form an adjoint pair:\n\\[  \nB_S \\dashv R_S : \\mathcal{C} \\leftrightarrows \\mathcal{D}  \n\\]\nNatural Isomorphism:\n\\[  \n\\text{Hom}_{\\mathcal{D}}(B_S(X), Y) \\cong \\text{Hom}_{\\mathcal{C}}(X, R_S(Y))  \n\\]\nThis captures how boundaries (e.g., cell membranes) constrain relations (e.g., metabolite exchange) while enabling higher-order organization.\n\n\n0.5.2 Dynamic Convergence\nIdentity emerges as the fixed point of boundary-relation interplay:\n\\[  \n\\frac{d\\text{Id}}{dt} = \\kappa(\\text{Boundary}, \\text{Relation}) \\cdot \\text{Id}  \n\\]\nwhere \\[ \\kappa \\] encodes curvature in the interaction landscape.

A cell is not a thing with a boundary but a persistent pattern of molecular interactions.

They are the syntax through which systems compose into larger wholes while maintaining their integrity.\nFrom quantum decoherence to cellular membranes to social institutions, the same pattern emerges: sustainable systems require boundaries that are neither too rigid nor too fluid, but dynamically responsive to context while preserving core structural invariants.\nThe mathematical framework developed here—hierarchical ranks, adjoint functors, convergence dynamics—provides tools for understanding how boundaries operate across scales without reducing higher-level phenomena to lower-level mechanisms. Each scale has its own boundary logic, connected to but not determined by adjacent scales.\n\nNote: This framework positions boundaries as the bridge between identity (internal coherence) and relations (external interaction), setting the stage for understanding how relational patterns emerge and stabilize across scales."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this paper I’ll explore the structural and conceptual parallels between my previous notes on on boundaries, identities, and self-referential systems. I’ll try to go about it through a in development review of Noether’s theorems in theoretical physics. This studying approach is done upon the De Haro, S. (2021)’s article, on Noether’s Theorems and Energy in General Relativity. From here, I’ll analytically try to compare my previous formalisation attempts, that include boundary functors, identity convergence theorems, and Heraclitean inspired transform, continuing my pursuit in understanding more deeply if a relational invariance exists, grounded in physical known principles, and if so, when contemplating a bridge between physical conservation laws. I’ll do it so while also addressing the question and pertinent critiques of conflation between mathematical isomorphism with ontological independence, when I explore the possibility that structured redundancies may allow for coherence across scales.\nTo enumerate some insights and driving questions from my previous work, where we explored Boundaries, Identities, and Relations from a scale agnostic perspective, we have:\n\nBoundaries as a polysemic term, which I though it could imply a deeper insight across term employment,\ngiven that intuitively most stable systems seem to balance local autonomy with global coordination,\nand most things seem to be made up of other things,\nwhere nested identities relate to larger structures.\nIdentity, also a polysemic term, in the social and psychological domains seems elusive to quantify and qualify,\nhowever from a broader perspective an identity seems to imply a form of resistance and permeability to persist and adapt.\nThis selective permeability and relational coupling, seems to suggest that things exists via a boundary phenomenon where disorder tends to order through the potential range of interaction each thing has.\nSo at scale, Identity, is dependant? of boundaries,\nthis dependence is given by the tension between maintaining those boundaries (resistance to change) for maintaining relationships (coupling to others) and itself (Identity).\nTangibly, the examples are: \\(Physical Boundaries (Cell) → Mathematical Boundaries (Range) → Social Boundaries (Collective Identity)\\)\nThis puts Identity not a thing but a process,\nWhere a dynamic boundary maintained through the continuous negotiation of resistance and relation, autonomy and connection, self and other.\n\nSo what does this have to do with Noether’s theorems, and to conservation as property of symmetry and boundary conditions?\nBased on some preliminary and very naive computational drafts, where I aimed to address commonalities on how boundaries may work across all scales, I posited (based on the bioelectric experimental evidence a power law mapping exchanges) that we could use this invariance to predict the existence or not of an Identity also across scales.\nUsing a cell’s base case, when membranes act as boundaries (∂) that filter and allow for interactions, enabling stable cellular identity we got:\nIdentity contraction factor λ = 0.9957\nConvergence rate = 0.0043\nand thus:\nVoltage convergence with λ ≈ 0.15\nBoundary resistance at (-0.1·V)\nWhere a cell’s stable voltage pattern was given from summing boundary-filtered interactions, such as that our preliminary formalisation as:\n\\[ Identity=∑∂(interactions)\\]\nThen, the idea was to check if we could use this template in Social Systems, where negotiation between individual boundaries and collective relations were given by tradeoff of social norms. Of course this is a huge leap from cell to social systems, but I was hopping to simply record this idea for later and more detailed exploration. A rigorous approach must consider applying the experimental template from \\(Cell -&gt; Tissue -&gt; Organ -&gt; Organism -&gt; Collective\\). For the sake of example the premise could be that social boundaries mappable “habits”, as patterns that are given from repeated interface interactions (narratives, culture and so on) and subsequently constrain future interactions.\nNaturally, we could not proceed without addressing and considering what we know at the moment concerning general energy exchange. While not being at the moment brilliantly versed in the subject, I surly aim to seek a deeper understanding on all the matters discussed here. As mentioned several time throughout, the invariance at stakes concerns physical laws. This invariance is also denoted as a symmetry in physics. Symmetry also refers to the property of particles under transformations (rotation, translation, reflection).\nIn Einstein’s theories of relativity, we have two spaces, one that is flat and another that is curved, and is worth noting that symmetries can be continuous or discrete.\nFrom the assumption that Identities are physical, and the hypothesis that therefore they can be measured the later is sustained due to ontological dependence (and logical implication) that an Identity has to its Boundary, they could not exist or coming to be in a flat relational space, because if things were able to exist in isolation, with no interactions, these identities / entities would move in straight lines through time, unchanging.\nThus, just as Einstein posit that gravity isn’t a force pulling objects but the geometry of spacetime itself, identity must not be a property of entities but the intrinsic geometry of their relational embedding; and one way to measure it could be by the “trajectory of becoming” an entity traces through this curved identity space.\n[Philosophy]  \n|  \n|  \"Identity requires boundaries and relations\"  \n↓  \n[Category Theory]  \n|  \n|  B_S ⊣ R_S (Boundary-Relian adjunction)  \n↓  \n[Type Theory]  \n|  \n|  Id(S) = { R | ∀f, f∘R = R∘f }  \n↓  \n[Physics]  \n|  \n|  D(Id)/Dt = κ(Boundary, Relation) · Id  \n↓  \n[Biology]  \n|  \n|  Cell identity = Membrane + Metabolic Exchange\nThis progressive instantiable hypothesis seems rather relevant in practical terms when there is a meed to predict identity crisis (systems losing coherence) occurring when curvature exceeds critical thresholds. (need to elaborate on tangible examples) The tension between Heraclitus’ flux (“no man steps in the same river twice”) and Hegel’s dialectical stability (“the river persists through change”) may find resolution in relational geometry. Moreover, the flat space exemplified before can be seen as a limiting and preliminary case where boundaries exist but are inert, serving us as a useful abstraction but not an empirical reality as boundaries only become meaningful when mediating interaction.\nIf by analogy, we posited it as: \\[\nDt/DId =κ(Boundary,Relation)⋅Id\n\\]\nwhere just as spacetime curvature is encoded in the metric (pseudo) tensor \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\), I experimented that identity could be represented measuring how “close” two relational directions could be in identity space as \\[g_{\\text{id}}^{ab}(x) = \\langle \\partial_a \\text{Id}(x), \\partial_b \\text{Id}(x) \\rangle\\]\nThings I need to do after:\n\nTest my convergence predictions against real group formation dynamics\nExplore how boundary conditions (superpotential) affect identity stability across different scales\nMapping my coupling matrix to actual social network data\n\nThe intuition about identity as curvature seems profound, however I lack the knowledge and skills as for now to fully develop and test it.\n\nThe Geometric Insight: From Flat to Curved Identity Space Imagine a flat relational space where all entities exist in isolation, no interactions, pure Euclidean geometry of being. In such a space, identity would indeed be intrinsic (Aristotelian ousia), and entities would move in straight lines through time, unchanging.\n\nBut the moment we introduce interactions, the moment Axioms 1-3 come into play, this flat space becomes curved. Just mass-energy curves spacetime, boundary-relation tension curves identity space.\nFlat Identity Space (No Relations):\nEntity A ———————————→ A' (unchanged)\nEntity B ———————————→ B' (unchanged)\n\nCurved Identity Space (With Relations):\nEntity A ～～～～～～～～～～→ A* (transformed)\n        ＼    ｜      ／\n         ＼   ｜     ／\n          ＼  ｜    ／ ← Curvature induced by\n           ＼ ｜   ／    boundary-relation tension\n            ＼｜  ／\nEntity B ～～～～～～～～～～→ B* (transformed)\n\n\nThe equation \\[\\frac{D\\text{Id}}{Dt} = \\kappa(\\text{Boundary}, \\text{Relation}) \\cdot \\text{Id}\\] seems analogous to Einstein’s field equations \\[G_{\\mu\\nu} = 8\\pi T_{\\mu\\nu}\\] following the reasoning:\n\nIdentity as Metric Tensor\nJust as spacetime curvature is encoded in the metric tensor \\[g_{\\mu\\nu}\\], identity can be represented as a relational metric: \\[g_{\\text{id}}^{ab}(x) = \\langle \\partial_a \\text{Id}(x), \\partial_b \\text{Id}(x) \\rangle\\]\n\nThis measures how “close” two relational directions are in identity space. - Curvature from Boundary-Relation Stress The identity curvature tensor \\[\\kappa\\] emerges from the stress-energy of boundary maintenance and relational interaction:\n\\[\\kappa_{\\mu\\nu} = \\underbrace{T_{\\text{boundary}}^{\\mu\\nu}}_{\\text{cohesion stress}} + \\underbrace{T_{\\text{relation}}^{\\mu\\nu}}_{\\text{interaction stress}}\\]\n\nThe Geodesic Idea Entities follow geodesics in this curved identity space—the path of least “identity action”:\n\n\\[\\frac{d^2 x^{\\mu}}{d\\tau^2} + \\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\nu\\rho} \\frac{dx^{\\nu}}{d\\tau} \\frac{dx^{\\rho}}{d\\tau} = 0\\]\nwhere \\[\\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\nu\\rho}\\] are the Christoffel symbols of identity space.\nWhy This Matters?\nRemember our river example?

This is why the Axiom 2 works:\n\\[\\text{Id}(S) = \\{ R \\mid \\forall f: S \\to T, \\, f \\circ R = R \\circ f \\}\\]\nThe curvature \\[\\kappa\\] is an intrinsic property of identity space, it doesn’t depend on how we coordinatize the relational system, just as Gaussian curvature doesn’t depend on how we embed a surface.\nThe train of thought was leading to this: Identity is not a thing that has relations, identity IS the curvature created by relational dynamics. (Because in principle a thing will be made of energy or matter if we want to make a distinction)\nJust as someone once realised that gravity isn’t a force pulling objects but the geometry of spacetime itself, perhaps we could propose that identity isn’t a property of entities but the intrinsic geometry of their relational embedding.\nThe “trajectory of becoming” is simply the worldline an entity traces through this curved identity space, guided by the geodesic principle, always taking the path of minimal “identity stress.”\n\n\n\n\nCausal fermion systems (CFS), bioelectric dynamics, and assembly theory into a unified relational framework. Scaling laws governing biological systems (e.g., \\[ \\lambda \\propto \\sqrt{D\\tau} \\]) come from quantum-relational dynamics encoded in fermionic correlations. Computational validation if true could reveals conserved power-law exponents (\\[ \\gamma = 2.1 ? \\pm 0.1 ? \\]) across scales, suggesting a fundamental “relational floor” set by CFS, bridges quantum gravity and biological self-organization, and offering tools to predict and manipulate relational states from cells to civilizations.\n\n\n\nThe relational universe hypothesis posits that entities emerge from interaction networks, not vice versa.

    "section": "1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nWhat does it mean for a thing to be itself? The following note explores Identity, through an approach that is intentionally interdisciplinary, colouring outside the lines so to speak. At its core, this question asks of us to discern and explain what are the criteria and conditions and the eventful fortune allowing for a proto-thing to be, towards becoming a thing, distinct, separated, and identifiable.\nTraditionally, identity has been posed as an intrinsic property, defined by an immutable essence 1. Yet, this precedent, was followed by a vast, and accumulated body of knowledge, and ongoing process of examining why and how is a thing a thing as a central metaphysical and ontological question, where and great philosophers, thinkers and poets, have wrestled with what makes an entity a “thing” as opposed to mere stuff, a property, apart from nothing.\n1  Aristotle’s ousia2 Bill Brown notes that “thingness” comes when habitual relationship to an object is disrupted, forcing a reconfiguration of our relation to it. Thus, a “thing” is less an intrinsic property and more a manifestation of a particular subject-object relationHeidegger, distinguishes between objects and things arguing that thingness is not simply a matter of physical properties or scientific description, but is deeply connected to how things are encountered by humans in their practical and conceptual lives (Heidegger 1967). Drawing from Heidegger and critical theory, Thing theory, further explores the distinction between objects, with clear roles and uses, and things ,which assert themselves when they break down or elude understanding(Brown 2001), 2 and while Hegel and Mead argued that identity arises dialectically through interaction with the “other”, I wonder if the relational aspect holds consistently outside a human-centric context.\n\n\n\nfirst use of =\n\n\nWhen brimming the foundations of logic into the origin and nature of identity, we find relevant thoughts on how something bears a relation to itself, and the conventional equivalence expression, such as \\((x=x)\\) (Lawvere 2003), where the Law of Identity \\(\\forall x(x = x)\\) gives way to relational predicates such as \\(x =_F y\\) (x is the same F as y) (“Identity and Contextual Semantics in Complex Systems” 2019) (Müller 2023).\nWhichever name we chose to represent this, or any other “thing”, is a reference to it, thus it would be quite a reduction to say A thing is a thing as a ball is a ball. However, Aristotle’s attempts to specify identity through distinction, and conversely, via tautological expressions of identity, the relation a thing bears with itself seem to be partially useful, as the relations it holds to what is not “itself”, may reveal a sort of proprietary and informing uniqueness. On various ways of questioning about the thing some make yet another clear distinction between objects and things (Heidegger 1967) where “things” are human concepts where “thingness” could not be reducible to its material composition or its role as a bearer of properties. While I disagree with these statements, his proposal of “things” constituted through its relations, functions, seem pertinent.\nLanguage certainly plays a role in how we individuate and talk about things, the axioms of identity are not merely linguistic conventionsm, and regardless of human symbolic attribution interprets and generates observations, materialising them in structured categorisation and classification of things such as a cell, a cell is a cell via its membrane. No membrane, no cell. There is no contradiction, as the cell cannot be and not be simultaneously. But if we call it “kgkds” instead of a cell, and attribute it to the same object, it would not change the fact that the object in question requires an identity to persist, and that part of that identity is its own morphological description. This, partially agrees with Aristotelians and partially disagrees with positivists who argue that contradictions in nature result from linguistic or cognitive errors given by our perceptual limitations.\nIn the world of things, nothing can be a part of itself, or so it is said. In mathematics, the identity of objects (e.g., groups, spaces) are defined by their morphisms, structure-preserving maps, which must then be articulated while preserving how these maps map to other groups (e.g., via homomorphisms). This preservation then, of composition, must stay coherent for belonging as well, where by belonging, one refers to a situated part in a whole, such as in a hierarchy 4 (e.g., natural numbers in Peano arithmetic), and for a mereological arrangements.\nHowever, we have three problems: 1. Being: the scale of things 2. Belonging: the place of things at scale 3. Becoming: before the thing\nParadoxes such as Who shaves the barber, and Does infinity contain itself or not? are familiar and I’m curious as to which methods we could use in both cases, for the barber and the infinity, that resolve self-reference. One preliminary idea is that they themselves are a boundary, a formal interface to something else much like the cell or the reference object “kgkds”.\nIf we make a clear distinction between belonging (cell belonging to tissue) and composing (morphisms of atoms and molecules into cells), and allow specification and regularity (set/subset - blocking self membership Zermelo-Fraenkel) atoms compose and belong to cells simultaneously and there is no contradiction because they refer (belonging / composition) to different levels of abstraction (hierarchical description composition &lt; belonging). They are formalized in logic and mathematics as equivalence relations (reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity). Some have argued that identity predicates are “ontologically generative” meaning that the very act of identifying or individuating things helps constitute the structure of reality itself. What would happen if we merged aristotle distinction, and had a numerical identity (being one and the same) and qualitative identity (sharing properties) both formalised? Would it be sound to frame these properties as relational domain and range? Carrying the proposal to a bio-physical realm, a cell’s identity, for instance, is potentially given by what allows for metabolic interfaces with its environment, a membrane. Without it, a cell would not be a cell, but loose environmental material. Perhaps identity is better put as requiring the “allowing” of self, which could be obfuscating the “allowing” for relation.\n\nBeing - Composition: the scale of things\nBelonging - Nearness: the place of things at scale\nBecoming - Allowance: before the thing\n\nFurther tension seems to point in the case of cross-domain applicability, as boundary ambiguity requires having an answer to how “sharp” must a boundary be? And how stable? Do ranges of variation in identity alike the established “tree-ness” throughout the seasons impose a clear constraint on the identity boundaries of a tree as an object, that according to a substance-ontology, where change is part of persistence.\nThe central ideas of Heraclitus’s saw a shared trait in the opposites and this was change. His insights on the perceived world as *constantly in flux, always “becoming” but never “being” contrasting with Parmenides, for whom “being” that was immutably static. (Curd 2022). In the river’s aphorism the river persists as “river” despite complete molecular turnover, while the man’s identity shifts through the very act of stepping. We we entertain the idea and explore it trough formalism, where can it takes us?\nThere is an implicit suggestion that identity is neither static substance nor mere flux, but a processual coherence that emerges through relation, river maintaining form despite molecular turnover via the terrain where if flows (Whitehead 1929) alike a human body replaces most cells from time to time, yet is still structurally recognizable through DNA-protein feedback loops. Similarly, online communities persist through member turnover via shared discourse patterns. Here, the relation is an state-enabled happening that occurs both in space and time, regardless of embodiment. Can the boundaries of self, and the embodied interface of things be some form of adjoint functors, and persist not despite change, but through it?\n\\[\n\\begin{CD}\n\\text{Man}_t @&gt;&gt;&gt; \\text{River}_t\n@VVV @VVV\n\\text{Man}_{t+1} @&gt;&gt;&gt; \\text{River}_{t+1}\n\\end{CD}\n\\]\nHere, both man and river are transformed through their interface, the ability to interact, and what it interacts with. Hegel’s becoming identity is a fixed point in the dialectic of boundary maintenance and relational adaptation, and via reflexivity of higher-order adjunctions, boundaries become objects of interaction, suggesting that to exist is to be a morphism in the category of becoming (Simondon 1958; DeLanda 2006).\nThe river’s identity depends on both its internal flow and its interaction with the man, and pointed to as a reference by the man. The river’s identity is co-constitutive. The man’s identity is also altered by the river (e.g., wet feet, shifted perspective), suggesting a relational asymmetry.\n\nAs the same thing in us are living and dead, waking and sleeping, young and old. For these things having changed around are those, and those in turn having changed around are these.(B88)\n\n\n1.1 1.Identity\nIn question is the nature of identity, one one hand we have the relation to itself, what “allows” persistence, but persistence seems to be then connected to whatever is not part ot that identity almost as a constructive-coupling. This echoes notions of intrinsic and extrinsic information. Absolute identity is unique to each object; relative identity allows for sameness “in some respect” (e.g., two things might be identical in structure but not in context). which is analogous to identity being differential, in the sense that difference is what makes a pattern persist amid noise (Spencer-Brown 1969), but both the asymmetry and the opposite cannot be seen as static when the essence is transience.\nProposed definition: A contextually process allowed and sustained by differential relations between intrinsic self-maintenance and extrinsic coupling. Formal Requirements: The relation each thing bears to itself (∀x(x = x)), extended beyond tautological self-reference to encompass processual persistence Nature: Identity as dynamic tension between internal phase separation (self-organization) and external interaction (environmental coupling) Temporal Dimension: Distinguished between synchronic identity (sameness at a time) and diachronic identity (persistence through time via structured continuity) Empirical Adequacy: Identity formalized as measurable persistence of organizational patterns amid material flux[7][3] Operational Definition: Identity as sheaf over interaction contexts: I_S(U) = {Properties of S observable in context U}[8][9] Boundary Conditions: Depends on boundary formation and maintenance through selective permeability and gradient-based separations Formal Expression: Identity = lim→(Internal Phase Separation) × lim←(External Interaction) Unifying Principle: Identity as a capacity to maintain organisational coherence while allowing selective environmental coupling."

    "text": "2 2. Being\nBoth Mead and Hagel posed that this relationship with a “generalised-other” allows for the development of self-awareness 3 which imply clear boundary of self—allowing for relation, but also demarcating what is not-self.Gilbert Simondon’s On the Mode of Existence of Technical Objects (Simondon 1958) challenges the traditional cultural divide between humans and technology, arguing for a deeper understanding of technical objects as dynamic, evolving entities. While he beautifully critiques the reduction of technology to mere utility or alienating forces, proposing instead a framework that examines their genesis, evolution, and integration into human culture, from it a insight lies when he emphasizes the open-ended potential nature of objects. Others have found this insight pertinent as it intersects with Alfred North Whitehead’s process philosophy and Manuel DeLanda’s assemblage theory, refining notions of being, repositioned as fomalisable objects that adequately map to dynamic, and multi-scale processes observed in physical phenomena (Whitehead 1929; DeLanda 2006).\n3 human: social-dynamics and self-awarenessSo if there are no fixed “things”, and identity with operable definition \\(I_S(U) = {Properties of S observable in context U}\\) with formal expression \\(Identity = lim→(Internal Phase Separation) × lim←(External Interaction)\\), where boundary conditionals containing a “thing” into “becoming” as gradient-like transient states (e.g., cell membranes, social identities) with temporal expression both synchronic(sameness at a time), and diachronic (structured continuity), where in both spatio-temporal contructs there seems to be selective process for exchange “allowing” relation, for intrinsinc and extrinsic directions, how can we make sense of how to generalise being in identity?\nProposed definition: Being is the compositional scale of things, what allows for self-maintenance and boundary formation at a given level of organization in given spactio-temporal dimensions.\nFormal Requirements: 1. Agreement: Agreeing with the operable identity definitions \\(I_S(U) = {Properties of S observable in context U}\\) with formal expression \\(Identity = lim→(Internal Phase Separation) × lim←(External Interaction)\\) 2. Scalar Organization: Nested hierarchies of composition and organization 3. Boundary Formation: Requires the capacity to form and maintain boundaries that enable selective interaction 4. Morphological Basis: Grounded in observable morphological structures that enable metabolic interfaces 5. Self-Organization: Through self-organizing processes that maintain structural integrity Nature: Temporal Dimension: Synchronic manifestation of organizational patterns that enable diachronic persistence through environmental flux Empirical Adequacy: Observable through morphological structures, metabolic interfaces, and thermodynamic boundary maintenance in physical systems Operational Definition: Being as structured cospan S → I ← E where S mediates between intrinsic invariants (I) and extrinsic environment Conditionals: 1. If boundary formation occurs, then selective permeability is enabled 2. If self-maintenance processes exist, then organizational coherence is preserved Formal Expression: \\(Being = {S | ∃ boundary ∂S enabling selective coupling}\\) Principle: Being requires the capacity to form and maintain boundaries that enable selective environmental interaction while preserving organizational coherence\n\n2.1 3. Belonging\nContemplating the mereological contributions of part-whole relationships, however static they may be in classic mereology there’s something of interest to said regarding levels of abstraction, composition and belonging. Identity can be mereologically defined:\\(x = y\\) if and only if x and y have the same parts, and this approach makes mereology a simpler choice compared to those requiring separate identity predicates. However, in processual ontologies, this definition becomes problematic since parts are constantly changing while identity persists (Simons 1987). Comparing a relational perspective, which treats concrete particulars as “blobs” without internal ontological structure, with constituent ontologies, that analyze internal composition, a processual approaches offers us here a middle path, one where entities have dynamic structure given from ongoing part-whole relationships rather than fixed composition alone.\nProposed Definition: Belonging is the contextual participation of entities in larger organizational structures while maintaining distinct processual identity through multi-scale coherence. Formal Requirements: 1. Multi-scale coherence conditions 2. Part-whole relationship preservation 3. Hierarchical organizational consistency Nature: Relational property that enables entities to participate in larger systems while maintaining their distinct organizational integrity. Temporal Dimension: Persistent participation patterns that maintain coherence across temporal scales and organizational transitions. Empirical Adequacy: Measurable through functional roles, emergent properties, and hierarchical integration in complex systems. Operational Definition: Belonging as sheaf morphism \\(B: Local{_identity} → Global{_context}\\) preserving local coherence within global structures. Conditionals: 1. If multi-scale coherence exists, then hierarchical participation is enabled 2. If part-whole relationships preserve identity, then belonging is maintained Formal Expression: \\(Belonging = {B(S,C) | S maintains identity while participating in context C}\\)\nPrinciple: Belonging enables multi-scale participation while preserving distinct processual identity through contextual coherence mechanisms.\n\n\n2.2 4. Becoming\nWe took so far important steps, however, we are left with an important task regarding the spatio-temporal allowance for identity formation. The process of “becoming” suggests that things are allowed to become. Contextual embeddings at scale (local - global) which seems then to implicate a spacio-temporal significance in the sign-making process which seems in turn aligned with everything we know in developmental and evolutionary disciplines.\nFirst things first, the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of things, and the tension allowing persistente we may draft that:\n\\[\nIdentity=lim→(Internal Phase Separation)×lim←(External Interaction)\n\\]\nSumming up the idea of a dynamic tension between internal differentiation and external coupling, which at first seems phenomenological grounding and explains persistence amid change, but faces challenges in operationalising “process” boundaries. In the example of a cell, no mebrane no cell argument is not valid for a cloud, or what the sign of a cloud references to.\nSo instead of:\n\\[\nIdentity=lim→(Internal Phase Separation)×lim←(External Interaction)\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\text{Hom}(\\text{Sign}(X), \\text{Object}(Y)) \\cong \\text{Hom}(X, \\text{Interpretant}(Y))\n\\]\n\n\n\nnotebook-drawing\n\n\nWe may consider: \\[\n\\text{Identity} = \\lim_{\\rightarrow} (\\text{Internal Phase Separation}) \\times \\lim_{\\leftarrow} (\\text{External Interaction})\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Hom}_{\\mathcal{D}}(B_S(X,t), Y) \\cong \\text{Hom}_{\\mathcal{C}}(X, R_S(Y,t))\n\\]\nWhere intrinsic tension expressed as: \\[\nB_S \\dashv R_S : \\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{D}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Hom}_{\\mathcal{D}}(B_S(X,t), Y) \\cong \\text{Hom}_{\\mathcal{C}}(X, R_S(Y,t))\n\\]\nand fuzzy boundaries, our dynamims of said boundaries is expressed as:\n\\[\n\\partial S = \\int_{\\mathcal{E}} \\phi(S, E)\\, dE\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathcal{I}_S(U) = \\{ \\text{Properties of } S \\text{ observable in context } U \\}\n\\]\nTo handle fuzzy boundaries and contextual variation, we model identity as a sheaf over a site of interactions:\n\\[I_S(U) = \\{\\text{Properties of } S \\text{ observable in context } U\\}\\]\nIdentity persists when local sections glue coherently across overlapping contexts. This resolves the boundary ambiguity problem by treating sharpness as contextual rather than absolute.\nWith temporal properties as:\n\\[\n\\text{Id}(X) = \\lim_{\\rightarrow \\text{interactions}} X_t\n\\]\nWith identity criteria as:\n\\[\n\\overline{S} = \\{ f \\in \\text{Hom}(S, S) \\mid B_S(f, t) = \\text{id}_S \\}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Id}(S, \\mathcal{K}) = \\{ R \\mid \\forall f \\in \\mathcal{K}: S \\to T,\\ f \\circ R = R \\circ f \\}\n\\]\nMutual parthood is possible during phase transitions when structured cospans exhibit non-trivial automorphisms, formalizing developmental plasticity. We may represent dynamic systems as structured cospans:\n\\[S \\to I \\leftarrow E\\]\nWhere:\n\\(I\\): Intrinsic invariants (core organizational patterns)\n\\(E\\): Extrinsic interactions (environmental coupling)\n\\(S\\): The system mediating between internal and external domains\nPersistence Condition: A system maintains identity if there exists a retract \\(r: E \\to I\\) such that\n\\[\nr \\circ S = \\text{id}_I\n\\] This ensures intrinsic stability amid extrinsic flux.\nAnd given than identity may recur:\n\\[\n\\text{Boundary} \\xrightarrow{\\text{enables}} \\text{Interaction} \\xrightarrow{\\text{reinforces}} \\text{Boundary}\n\\]\nThis creates a state like point where being and becoming coincide:\n\\[\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{I}(S)) = S \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathcal{I}(\\mathcal{B}(S)) = S\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) is the boundary operator and \\(\\mathcal{I}\\) is the interaction operator.\n\nThings stand in different truths, Heidegger says, meaning that the way a thing is understood depends on the conceptual and practical attitudes brought to it.

    "text": "3 Discussion\nExploring this notion of boundaries via contextual sheaves seems to allow a few interesting configurations. Another approach as a boundary-centric model treating identity as a fixed container, like a cell membrane statically filtering molecules, would conflict with real-world systems such as immune cells that self from non-self, or social identities adapting to cultural contexts. Boundaries must be transient, adaptive permeable states. Via sheaves, or better put, by framing identity as a sheaf \\[ \\mathcal{I}_S(U) \\], where boundarie sharpness is locally defined but globally coherent.\nA tree, finds its identity across seasons, not inspite of having leaves or not, but by budding spring leaves (extrinsic domain \\[ \\int_e F(x) \\]) which vary wildly, but with vascular invariants (intrinsic \\[ \\int_i F(x) \\]) persist. In winter, leafless branches still satisfy the sheaf’s gluing condition, overlapping contexts which maintain coherence. This oposes substance ontology’s “tree-as-object” in favor of processual glueing, where identity exhibits local properties (e.g., photosynthesis in summer, dormancy in winter) yet agree on overlaps (e.g., nutrient storage in autumn), unlike static boundaries, sheaves allow identity to be renegotiate as its edges change contextually.\nThe implicit code-duality which I originally expressed via morphisms to signs (\\[ \\text{Info}: \\text{Morph}(\\mathcal{C}) \\to \\text{Sign}(\\mathcal{S}) \\]), struggled with ambiguous encodings (a gene encoding multiple protein isoforms), however now, information can actually be expressed as a sheaf morphisms \\[\n\\text{Info}: \\text{Hom}(A, B) \\to \\Gamma(\\mathcal{I}_S, \\mathcal{I}_T)\n\\]\nwhere for instance a DNA sequence (\\(A\\)) maps to a section of possible protein folds (\\[ \\Gamma(\\mathcal{I}_S) \\]), constrained by cellular context (e.g., chaperone availability).\nMore spceifically, thegene FOXP2 has a role in speech evolution which isn’t just about nucleotide sequence (intrinsic domain) but its interaction with neural crest cell environments (extrinsic sheaf \\[ \\mathcal{I}_S(U) \\]). Code-duality thus becomes a dialogue between invariant genetic “text” and context-dependent “meaning.”\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\text{Man}_t & \\longrightarrow & I_{\\text{metabolism}} \\\\\n\\downarrow &  & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\text{Man}_{t+1} & \\longrightarrow & \\text{River}_{t+1}\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nThe map \\(r\\) ensures metabolic invariants (\\(I\\)) stabilize the system against external perturbations (e.g., the man drinking river water, the river reshaping its banks). And phase-transitions may be tracked when perturbations exceed $ &lt; 0.3$ (pollution altering river pH?), the cospan \\(S \\to I \\leftarrow E\\) bifurcates, forcing identity reconfiguration (need better expamples than the man developing immunity, the river evolving microbial communities).\nIn Heraclitus’ paradox, the river’s identity is not despite molecular turnover but because its sheaf \\[ \\mathcal{I}_{\\text{river}}(U) \\] gluing local flow states (rapids, pools) into a global process, strenghening the argument of a relational identity, which beyond adjoint functors,\n$B_S R_S $ (boundaries ↔︎ relations) implied symmetry, however beautiful, conflics observations. Observations concerning identity suggest that this is morelikely to be asymmetric. A neuron’s identity, for example, seems more influenced by synaptic inputs ($ R_S \\() than its own firing patterns (\\) B_S \\(). I beleive that via **structured cospans** and **domain relativity** the **intrinsic domain** may be well expressed through ion channel configurations (\\)_i F(x) \\() which maintain homeostasis, and **extrinsic domain** by neurotransmitter interactions (\\) _e F(x) $) which then rewire the connectome.\nAlmost as if identity becomes a limit reconciling these domains (intrinsic - extrinsic)\n\\[\\text{Id}(\\text{neuron}) = \\lim_{\\to \\text{network activity}} \\left( \\int_i F(x) \\times \\int_e F(x) \\right)\n\\]\n\n3.1 Conclusion\nIdentity is neither a static essence nor an human construct, I posit that it must be a contextually coherent process sustained by differential relations. What I thouth to be a convergent limit where intrinsic properties persisted (\\[ \\int_i F(x) \\]) allowing for categorical extrinsic interactions (\\[ \\int_e F(x) \\]), much like a river flowing, simultaneously shaped and shaping the terrain. To “step into the river twice” seems akin to look at the mirror in two distinct moments, where cellular turnover, memories, and the seasons made any man different from who he was before.\nSo, identity is like a tension between phase-spaces. The problem here is the nature of boundaries, which for some cases requires a formalis for them that includes fuzzy descriptions without decoherence. This seems required in cases of clouds and for cultures, where a boundary (\\[ B_S \\]) filters and conditions interactions which are bounded by it (\\[ R_S \\]) and in turn, reshape those very constraints and its contents. For obvious reasons this touched the notion of sheaf morphisms, where compatibility conditions ensure local-to-global consistency without rigid invariance. In contrast to what I thought initially, the “self” must not be merely the expression of a limit \\[ \\text{Id}(X) = \\lim_{\\to \\text{interactions}} X_t \\] but the structured cospan reconciling intrinsic and extrinsic domains.\nLet \\[ S \\] be a system with intrinsic invariants \\[ I \\] and extrinsic environment \\[ E_t \\] at time \\[ t \\]. We could possibly define identity as a contextually coherent process, a transient state \\[ \\mathcal{I}(S, t) \\] realised through a structured cospan diagram \\[\nX_t \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} I \\xleftarrow{\\beta} E_{t+1}\n\\] where \\[ X_t \\] is the system state at time \\[ t \\], \\[ I \\] encodes intrinsic (metabolic, cognitive, or social) invariants, and \\[ E_{t+1} \\] is the extrinsic context at time \\[ t+1 \\]. Here identity persists if there exists a retract \\[ r: E_{t+1} \\to I \\] such that \\[ r \\circ \\beta = \\text{id}_I \\], ensuring invariants anchor the system amid environmental flux.\nBoundaries \\[ B_S \\] are not passive containers but phase-state mediators, they filter and condition interactions (\\[ R_S \\]), and are themselves reshaped by those interactions, requiring a formalism that accommodates fuzzy, context-dependent boundaries without decoherence.\nSheaf morphisms \\[ \\mathcal{I}_S(U) \\] guarantee local-to-global coherence, so identity is preserved when local properties glue across overlapping contexts. Thus, identity is a transient, operational state, which is given by the differential relation between internal and external states, where external coupling relations co-constituting what it means for a thing to be itself at any moment.\nIdentity must be a state and nothing more and boundaries must not be passive containers but phase-state mediators.\n\n\n3.2 References\n\n\nBrown, Bill. 2001. “Thing Theory.” Critical Inquiry 28 (1): 1–22. https://doi.org/10.1086/449030.\n\n\nCurd, Patricia. 2022. “Heraclitus.” 2022. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heraclitus/.\n\n\nDeLanda, Manuel. 2006.
