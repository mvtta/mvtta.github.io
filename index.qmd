###  Note of intent
I am, therefore I share.

This Open-Notebook is organized into the following categories:

* **Agency**: A series of articles and notes stemming from the central question "What is Agency?".  
* **Meaning**: A dedicated series to the question "What is meaning?".  
* **Intelligence**: Thinking about Intelligence from an AI/ML perspective, some informal reviews on latest developments.  
* **Experiments**: Some computational experiments related to the above. 
* **Infix**: Pointers and pins, an index to my current mind map of ideas and references. The purpose is dynamic, as I use the tree of information and links to share as a conversation propeller and contextual mapping to enrich physical dialogs with other Humans.
