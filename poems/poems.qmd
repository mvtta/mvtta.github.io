## Untitled

I don't know what to do\
Where to start?\
To do for others¬†my body goes\
my mind follows\
to do for me\
body is made of iron ¬†

## Untitled

For years\
All that was known¬†\
reality\
was mainly pain and scarcity ¬† lack of\
being chased by death.\
One day\
near the end\
rain came\
space was being shared\
the weather changed\
and the moons,¬†\
fertility\
no more drought ¬† no more loneliness\
for the small cactus. ¬† 241120

## ùì†

There is a place that does not fully exist,\
where you live.

A place where thoughts\
and guts get intertwined.

A place where there's only room for parts,\
mirrors.

There is yet another place\
where the grounding forces reside,\
where one rests.

In the soil,\
intestines are roots.\
Quintessence,\
inside the ether.

## Wayword?

Where is there to navigate?\
Plans are mere distractions.

Contractions of freedom though,\
with love I draft with you,\
life.

Planing is dreaming,\
a commitment to oneself,\
an engagement,\
between the now and the future.

Is signing on the Book of Life.

Often,\
also a whole strategy to survive in harsh environments,\
previsions of hope,\
Quixotean echos.

Giants?\
or nothing at all...

## Like walking under the rain

I'd rather think than not.\
Seems rather simple, but think about it.

Do it for more than a minute, and no I did not ask your opinion, only your thoughts.

How quickly you ended the conversation,\
I wish I had better skills to engage you in the discussion.

I disagree with your premise, do you care to elaborate?\
Wait, let's talk more.

## Dona Rute

Looking up at her against the blue sky\
with her blue eyes\
skin glazed with time,\
closeness, love.

Fearless, within her world.\
The weather was pleasant and soft.

Experience transcends formulation,\
there is no concept or framework to explain,\
the emotion present in that moment.

## Venting

Made of particles\
glued with toxins,

crumbs of all the crushing movement,

inaction.\
Silence decays alike\
all residents,\
disloyal exchange\
wind feeding flames\
and undeserving fools.

## Finally, at home

Do not know,\
incomprehensible,\
incapable,\
unpredictable,\
unchaste and unfolded auction\
induction on trial,\
veiled nonattendance,\
dancing the nothingness.

The gift of further breaking\
was humbled by some gracious voice\
audible at a distance.

## The fall of a house of cards

A line in\
light, a longing.\
Threading.

Oscillating\
oyster,\
alluring luck,\
ceases.

Prickling,\
titillating gimmick.\
A resemblance?

## Less

To understand it is a waste of time.\
The process of the process of the process,\
Any kind of self-inflicted suffering is a waste of time.\
Albeit any or many attempts,\
trying is also a waste of time.\
So, what does matter? (As in relevant, essential)

When wasting the same time,\
pondering how different narrative scenarios impact the lost moments of one's existence,\
does anything beyond this moment matter?

What would be appropriate, as a trajectory, from here, to there?

## W8

Hoje sinto-me pesada,

pesada o suficiente para me sentir presa ao ch√£o.

Tamb√©m me sinto fraccionada

ao ponto de me desintegrar,

quase quebro,

precede o est√≠mulo.

N√£o me parece que tenha raz√µes para isso.

N√£o sei o que fazer

e n√£o consigo fazer nada.

Sinto-me aflita,

gostava de conseguir abrir um buraco no diafragma e tirar com as minhas m√£os o parasita.

## Routine

Um lugar comum, banal e at√© estupido, diria.\
Claro, com uma grande carga julgativa sob o observado.\
Mesmo assim, continuo sem pudor: S√£o ondas, que √© como quem diz,\
Oscila√ß√µes.\
Como identificar as partes, das partes que comp√µem as ondas?\
Que sem nome, o atrapalham coitado.\
Mareado, enjoado, apresenta num quadro,\
O que seria esperado n√£o sai,\
Era simples, a audi√™ncia est√° inquieta, jugo que julga tamb√©m,\
coitado.\
Sai do mar apavorado, quase cai.\
As ondas batem nas cadeiras do escrit√≥rio,\
todos tem os seus sapatos, bem engraxado, agora manchados agora de sal.\
O sal queima.\
A reuni√£o da manh√£ descai sobre as horas n√£o convencionadas.\
A culpa √© dele que n√£o se preparou, para as vagas rotineiras.\
Quem se surpreende com a rotina.\
Ser√° um raro dist√∫rbio, ainda n√£o diagnosticado,

que aflige aqueles pobres coitados,\
normais por fora mareados por dentro?\

## $\pi$

Where you were doomed to be unhappy,

It elapsed into a faraway dimmed memory.

Perhaps time diluted itself in ancient cries as well

And gave birth to the void

where this infant threads a weave

of you and everything,

anew.

## COUNTER INTUITION IS INTUITION

When in an abyss of darkness,

Jump.

If facing a wall,

Climb.

Some die of exhaustion,

And not risk.

## Bruits

Reality collapsed

There‚Äôs blood and flesh everywhere

Remainders of dreams

Teeth and hair

Particles collapsed

Lost their magnetic charge

Let the poison of the debris contaminate

Decompose

After all the seconds

A pause.

## Untitled

Solitude is a sinful waste of time

If you‚Äôre only good by yourself,

and by good

I mean less bad, but still in pain,

within the walls of your house

a dormant volcano.

Outside life creates itself.

Some say that from pain comes growth,

but from constant pain comes decay

hope vanishes

and the energy to pretend you‚Äôre not hurt by being less of yourself

slowly fades.

## Untitled

I‚Äôm a raccoon, underground,

feeding from rests

Living a simple life,

Until death.

## Untitled

If color returns I‚Äôll quit blindness

## Untitled

The journey of an ant.

## Untitled

There is blood on the stairs,

Is it mine?

I see blood on my desk,

Is it mine?

What difference does it make?

## Untitled

Uma dan√ßa de figuras reflectidas em pain√©is transl√∫cidos molhados com l√°grimas de Deus

e suor desumano, dejectos defuntos d‚Äôalmas queimadas na hora de ser.

Aqui quem sabe no ar lambeu o sal do mar para matar a sede de ser.

L√° ao longe h√° um d√≥ de sol e l√° tamb√©m haver√° morte que corre pelas nove montanhas de dor, pronta a beber.

## Untitled

There‚Äôs a fine slice of light on the table,

and a paper of fine cotton

of fine plants

of fine sun

of fine galaxy

of fine fusion

of fine dust

of fine sugar cubes

of fine nothing.

Caring is the great escape, the sweet immaterial opium.

## Untitled

Anchors, drown me.

Pull me hard and don‚Äôt let me float to relief.

Lock me in the world of Men,

in this shell of meat, always thirsty.

Ground me at the bottom of the sea.

Keep me even if I cry,

so I can die among mortals,

of old age or chance.

Anchors, may you find in my suffering also my praise of gratitude.

## Untitled

My knees hurt, certainly from existence.

## Untitled

Time is an almost measurable measurement.

Term of quasi-existence.

## Untitled

Maybe time is like a huge cunning wave,

destructive and indifferent.

Maybe we, the lonely buoy

that in a life-time of hostility

live and die in the same crib, on the same day

a life-time of infancy.

## Untitled

The human perspective of time seems irrelevant.

It is not a measurement within human domain,

it‚Äôs unattainable data, the missing link.
