    "text": "This exploratory review aims at the intersection of synthetic intelligence and embodied cognition, life and intelligence, through a panoramic and ecological lens. From theory to applications, we shall examine some recent developments in AI/ML architectures and their applications, how concepts of digital signal processing and information theory overlap into novel approaches to error correction, communication protocols and sensing capabilities in the cybernetics context, and how these developments relate to the corpus of human knowing today. We’ll do so by acknowledging that while the nature of intelligence is still elusive, recent experimental evidence seems to support a broader understanding of concepts such as “alive”, “cognizant”, and “intelligent”. Touching upon some neglected ethical considerations, such as the nature of interactions, natural accountability revisited in a diversely populated planetary system where natural-synthetic gradient of entities and systems co-exist, and lastly on the novel intelligences and the nesting of systems into multiscale competency architectures. This panoramic review of the current state and future directions of research on intelligence, AI and ML, aims to stimulate discussion and inspire further interdisciplinary collaboration. Key topics include the mortal computation thesis, cross-modal hashing techniques, error correction methods, and biomimetic approaches to AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article is structured to provide a panoramic view of the subject, moving from broad concepts to specific applications and future implications. It begins with foundational definitions and distinctions, progresses through current challenges and innovative solutions, and culminates in a discussion of potential future developments and their societal impacts, and concluding with a brief reflection on future directions of AI research and the importance of interdisciplinary methods and teams.\nThroughout the text, technical concepts are explained using accessible language and analogies, making the content approachable for both specialists and general readers with an interest in AI. The article series is divided into sections:\n\nIntroduction: Here we define key terms and introduce the concept of synthetic intelligence.\n\nEbbs, Flows & Information: We’ll explore current challenges in AI/ML pipelines and innovative proposals.\n\nMoving Bodies: This section delves into the mortal computation thesis and its implications for AI.\n\nAdditional Considerations: This part covers broader implications and related developments in the field.\n\nImpact on AI Image Generation: We discuss how these concepts could be applied to image and video generation.\n\nConclusion: We wrap up with reflections on the future of AI and its societal impact.\n\nEach section is further divided into subsections for clarity and ease of navigation, but together the sections make up an entire piece, or booklet. A different format that also includes relevant quotes, diagrams, and code snippets to illustrate key points throughout the text.\nBy structuring the content in this way, the aim is to provide a comprehensive yet accessible overview of this pivotal techno-social-eco-logical shift. Standing at the cusp of a new era for disciplines, the internet, knowledge and humans, it seems of upmost importance to examine the convergence of various ideas - from computer science and neuroscience to philosophy and cybernetics - that are shaping the tools of today into the world and systems of tomorrow."

    "section": "3.1 The Mortal Computation Paradigm",
    "text": "3.1 The Mortal Computation Paradigm\nThe thesis of mortal computation is a fascinating idea that, when intersected with the future of AI/ML from both hardware and software perspectives, presents an opportunity to further narrow down the limiting ‘gap’ between those perspectives into a new realm of embodied intelligence.\nTo grasp the mortal computation thesis, we can take two roads: philosophical and physical.\nStarting with the philosophical standpoint, death, or the finitude of life, may be seen as the the ultimate mediator for life. Without awareness of mortality, survival may be a meaningless concept, and thus could adaptative devices to survive and thrive have evolved? Of course, there are degrees of such awareness, and this is no direct claim defining what it truly means to know the essence of mortality.\nBut it does beg an intriguing question: What if we gave machines the awareness to measure and estimate computational effort, life-span of parts, and available energy sources, along with the power to control and manage some hardware/software components to improve their functioning? This concept, which some call Biomimetic Intelligence. It’s a truly transdisciplinary effort, drawing insights from biophysics, cybernetics, cognitive science, and computational biology.\nMoving to the physical perspective, Hinton first introduced the concept of mortal computation in his lectures and talks, notably in his Romanes Lecture at the University of Oxford, and the core idea behind mortal computation is the inseparability of knowledge and hardware in computational systems. Unlike traditional digital computers where software and hardware are distinct, mortal computation proposes a model where the learned knowledge is intrinsically tied to the physical substrate it runs on. Alike the human brain, where cognitive processes are intimately linked to the neural substrate. Hinton argues that this integration could lead to more energy-efficient and potentially more powerful AI systems, albeit at the cost of the universality and perfect reproducibility offered by digital systems.\nThe theoretical underpinnings of mortal computation have been further explored and formalized in recent academic works, Ororbia et al. (2023), synthesizes research efforts in neuroscience-inspired AI and biomimetic computing. This work frames the mortal computation thesis through the Markov blanket formalism and circular causality, underpinned by the free energy principle.\nConnecting both perspectives, the intersection of cybernetics and philosophy in this context seems very interesting. Cybernetics views living things as complex systems with interconnected parts and feedback mechanisms, rather than as simple mechanical entities. Its principles of self-regulation and homeostasis help explain how living systems maintain stability and purpose. It is intriguing how some scholars have noted parallels between cybernetic ideas and concepts from Eastern philosophies - the emphasis on interconnectedness and circular causality in cybernetics resonates with some Buddhist and Taoist concepts. Naturally, discussion on the nature of consciousness, and the implications on theoretical frameworks exploring the question,\nThis brings together several key ideas framing the mortal computation thesis through the Markov blanket formalism and circular causality Geoffrey Hinton (2022) Kleiner (2024) Ororbia et al. (2023), underpinned by the free energy principle, and the nature of consciousness:\n\nHinton, Geoffrey. 2022. “Geoffrey Hinton – Exclusive q&a on His Latest Breakthrough.” Radical Ventures. https://radical.vc/geoffrey-hinton-exclusive-qa-on-his-latest-breakthrough/.\n\nKleiner, Johannes. 2024. “Consciousness Qua Mortal Computation.” arXiv Preprint arXiv:2403.03925.\n\nOrorbia, Alexander, Ankur Koul, Paul Fergus, Abir Hussain, and Yoonsuck Choe. 2023. “Mortal Computation: A Foundation for Biomimetic Intelligence.” arXiv Preprint arXiv:2311.09589.\n\nIt emphasizes circular causality, which is fundamental to cybernetic thinking.\nIt incorporates the concept of feedback loops, essential in both cybernetics and biomimetic systems.\nIt uses a mathematical framework to describe the boundaries of cognitive systems, relating to cybernetic ideas about system boundaries and information flow.\nThe Free Energy Principle, which underlies the mortal computation thesis, can be seen as an extension of cybernetic ideas about self-regulation and homeostasis.\nProposes an alternative to backpropagation in neural networks, potentially aligning more closely with biological learning processes and being more suitable for implementation in analog-like systems."

This could lead to some interesting developments in how AI systems process and interpret information. The potential for more energy-efficient architectures that mimic the brain’s low-power processing is another aspect that may be promising. As we push the boundaries of AI capabilities, finding ways to reduce energy consumption will be crucial. I would risk saying that there’s no bottom to the free-energy principle in general, and in this particular case, incorporating the principle could optimize synthetic learning processes in several ways:\n\nMore efficient self-organization and adaptation of models to their environment\nImproved generalization capabilities by minimizing surprise in novel situations\nPotentially faster convergence during training due to better alignment with biological learning principles"

The complexity of implementing mortal computation principles could lead to temporary setbacks in efficiency and accuracy. But this may be a necessary step towards greater advancements.\nAdaptation Period: There will likely be a period where we’ll have to adapt to new paradigms and tools. Our existing datasets and benchmarks might not be well-suited for evaluating biomimetic systems, so we’ll need to develop new evaluation methods. This could be a challenging but exciting time in the field.\n\n\n3.3.1 Potential Breakthroughs:\nAfter these initial hurdles, we could see some significant leaps forward:\n\nEfficiency Breakthrough: Once we successfully implement the principles of mortal computation, we might see dramatic improvements in energy efficiency and processing speed. This could enable much larger and more complex models to run on smaller, more affordable hardware.\nNovel Learning Capabilities: I’m particularly excited about the potential for biomimetic systems to demonstrate superior adaptability and generalization. We might see the emergence of more robust and flexible AI systems capable of handling a wider range of real-world scenarios.\nIntegration with Biological Systems: The thesis opens up fascinating possibilities for better integration between AI and biological systems, envisioning advanced brain-computer interfaces or hybrid computational systems that blur the lines between artificial and biological intelligence."

While mortal computation might offer initial benefits in energy efficiency, the long-term advantages of digital systems in scalability and algorithm implementation could lead to more significant improvements.\nI find this debate between computational paradigms fascinating, and may play an important role in shaping the future of AI hardware development."

    "section": "5.1 Embodied Models for Realistic Movement",
    "text": "5.1 Embodied Models for Realistic Movement\nThe potential for achieving extreme realism in moving images will likely require models to be embodied, at least at some stage of training. Recent work on motion capture and transposition, such as ByteDance’s Magic Avatar, demonstrates the ability to generate synthetic AI video with transposed actors and environments (ByteDance, 2023). Coupled with advancements in 3D environment reconstruction, like NVIDIA’s Neuralangelo could contribute to more realistic movement generation(Xiangli et al. 2023), We think we may be on the cusp of some really exciting breakthroughs in generating realistic motion and interactions.\n\nXiangli, Y., L. Xu, X. Pan, N. Zhao, A. Rao, C. Theobalt, B. Dai, and D. Lin. 2023. “Neuralangelo: High-Fidelity Neural Surface Reconstruction.”\nEmbodiment can mean many things and have as well many interpretations. The core idea is for the software to be bound to a container, and this container be intrinsically related to the software, where the feedback mechanisms, we discussed above, loop between one adn the other passing information of internal states and the surroundings. New sensing mechanisms and protocol design must then be developed, improves and optimized.\n\n5.1.1 Networks and Nature\nMuch is discussed on ‘Neural Networks’, and the neuron like computerized version enabling current AI/ML models. In the interest of the general public a few updates in said analogy is needed. The first is that as seem in the first section of this article, the role od bioelectric networks in evolution and intelligence is now in a maturing field of research, expand our understanding of intelence across scales. In fact, the ‘mind’ seems to be spread out the embodiment of the agent, where competencies are across these scales are then what makes up the mind, awareness, stores memory, etc. On the Multiscale Competency Architecture and TAME (Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere) frameworks, the experiments seem quite clear, for example when introducing planaria worms in a beryllium solution their brains explode. However, they regenerate their brains entirely, and more surprisingly completely adapted to the solution, now causing no harm. The suggestion is that somehow the information on the harmful chemical, and what to do to adapt to this new environment was store and processed not in the brain, but elsewhere.\nNow, that we’ve introduce this new paradigm, a range of new possibility of architectures seems to open up for designing not only different software and models, but also hardware, or wetware for software embodiment.\nA very well known example is the ‘Mushroom Computer’, and unlocking the mycelium’s potential for computational purposes (Adamatzky A. 2018), but the contemporary ideas of Embodied Artificial Intelligence (EAI) (Damiano, L., & Stano, P. 2021) intercepted with TAME, give us the suggestion that whatever shape, form, composition and scale of the embodiment is self-informing of the kind of problems it will have the capacity to solve, and the size of it’s cognitive light cone. (ref). Roughly 30 years ago, researchers started modeling cognitive processes from the perspective of a computer and it’s architecture, and this programmatic idea stemmed from the now experimentally confirmed notion that cognition is an embedded relationship between software and hardware. Now, we may call it software and wetware as the notion transposed computer science into bioengineering and biomedicine, and from a scale free cognition and cybernetics perspective a cell is as much a wetware with running software as an auto-poetic system, open to evolve as the early 19th century notions of Humans being the only special kinds of agents that could learn and adapt willingly. Now we know that environments shape systems through feedback loops, within the measure that those systems may have adaptive mechanisms and their information processing throughput. Thus, the case for EAI is long established as an eminent future scenario, resting on the shoulders of previous generations of scientists, transdisciplinary ideas and ingenuity."

The mortal computation thesis, coupled with advancements in cross-modal hashing, error correction, and biomimetic approaches, presents exciting possibilities for more efficient, adaptable, and biologically-inspired AI systems. The integration of concepts like the Free Energy Principle and circular causality from cybernetics into AI architectures could lead to significant breakthroughs in how machines process information and interact with their environment. This could potentially result in AI systems that are not only more powerful but also more aligned with biological intelligence. However, as we navigate this new frontier, we must remain mindful of the challenges and ethical considerations that come with such advancements. The potential for extreme realism in generated content, the implications of stronger embodiment in virtual environments, and the need for responsible development of AI technologies are all critical aspects that require our attention. As we continue to push the boundaries of what’s possible in AI and ML, it’s clear that the future will be shaped by interdisciplinary approaches, combining insights from computer science, neuroscience, philosophy, and beyond. This convergence of ideas and technologies promises to unlock new realms of possibility, potentially revolutionizing our understanding of intelligence itself."

    "text": "5.4 Food For Though (And Discussions)\nReflect on these developments, a key observation lays on how rapidly technology is and will likely keep evolving. There’s no shortage of fascinating areas to explore, and the scenarios we will shortly live and whiteness are completely unforeseen. Some questions that seem worth thinking about are for example “What is the potential for high photorealism and personalization in avatars to lead to stronger embodiment and self-identification in virtual environments of Humans, and how will that impact the way we relate to each other and our non-virtual environment?”, and “How will societies evolver, adapt and integrate their cultural identities, having these new domains of interaction at the peer-relations level, and new means of individual self-expression?”. Moreover, we may ask: “What kind of new necessities will rise?”, “How will this new environment shape future generations into a new stage of Human Evolution?”, and “What kind of safe guards we can design for ourselves, to ensure that what we hold as valuable now, will persist in the future?”\nHaving synthetic, intelligent, or any kind of systems we may create, bound by biology or the same physical dynamics that we Humans are, seem to me a good premise for the sustainability of all ecosystems. Moreover it could enable and ensure the relational and regulatory means necessary, given the shared meta-substrate, a closed planetary system called Earth. Simply put, and alignment of interests.\nAdditionally, a intuition tells me that when striving for literacy at all levels of society and the continuous encouragement by facilitating the access to information and knowledge, is paramount. The reverse is a then the choice of alienating some, and deliberately incapacitating democracies, thus impacting policy-making, governance and constituting an obstruction to constructive debates and participatory politics.\nMoreover, as science and information become more complex, more specialized, a similar effort in bridging topics, simplifying language and streamlining the learning curve towards a panoramic understanding of the current knowledge map, seems, again, a sensible and tangible course of action towards current and future assurance of sense-making."

    "text": "Preface\n\n“This most of all: ask yourself in the most silent hour of your night: must I write? Dig into yourself for a deep answer. And if this answer rings out in assent, if you meet this solemn question with a strong, simple -I must-, then build your life in accordance with this necessity; your whole life, even into its humblest and most indifferent hour, must become a sign and witness to this impulse.” Reiner Maria Rilke\n\nIn embarking on this project, I found myself drawn to this question “What is agency?” which has fascinated many great thinkers across centuries and cultures. This question is deceptively simple yet profoundly complex, touching on the essence of action, interaction, causality, intention, and the organisation of systems ranging from cells to societies. My goal, initially, was to explore agency through various lenses, and look for binding principles across scales. As I developed some understanding, it struck me, not only were there points of convergence in how different disciplines understood agency as agency itself connected these disparate fields of study.\nI related how Aristotle’s concept of the “efficient cause” the agent or process that brings about change had a surprising resonance with D’Arcy Thompson’s work. In Thompson’s view, physical forces like gravity, surface tension, and pressure act as efficient causes, shaping the forms of living organisms. While Aristotle might have attributed these forms to a more teleological purpose, Thompson showed how physical laws could drive the development of complex structures, and these could be beautifully expressed through mathematics. Thompson’s exploration of forces acting on biological forms as identifying the physical efficient causes that structure life, seems quite relevant because in more modern terms we can consider physical forces as fundamental interactions. The study of the emergence of life tries to bridge with an understanding of how from those interactions complex life can emerge and self-organize.\nThat connection between efficient causes and the forces shaping the world felt/feel deeply significant, and continues to be relevant when delving into how forces that shape nature translate into self-organization. Observations related to order, scales and organisation are in turn connected to open questions of the origin of life, morphogenesis, and other forms of “becoming” of the world and into the world. Once “here”, things interact, predictions are made upon behaviors that seem determined by their nature and the laws that govern “everything”. Modern questions of causal theories and fundamental physics ask: How do interactions between fundamental particles lead to the emergence of complex structures and behaviors? What role does information play in shaping these processes? How can we understand causality at different levels of organization, from the quantum realm to the macroscopic world?\nThe relevance that these perspectives have in today’s research and governance practices was a compelling drive for this huge endeavor (I voluntarily) signed up for. After all, there is a dissonance in the apparent laws that govern things and the laws that Human societies use to organise and collaborate. Could deeper insights or even interpretations of the first help us address some of the challenges the second face?\nThere are many parallels and analogies drawn from physics to other fields of inquiry. There are also several reasonable arguments for the dissonance between the laws we call natural, and the ones we make. Put simply, they are different things, but are they? While the mystery of life and existence remains as is, living and non-living systems are composed of nested levels of organization, and while the fundamental level of reality is still in question, without a doubt the policies we make affect the reality we perceive, individually and collectively. Not just ours, but of all entities embedded in our environment, which some are so small we forget they too are embedded entities in their own environments. Environments which are made up of things that we change, build upon and draw from.\nAcross these hierarchies of how things become things by organised clumps of matter, observations tell us that from the very simple to the increasingly complex things interact, and from unorganised to orderly, and to decay things across scales exhibit “inter-active” properties. From light that bends to a gesture of affection, to forms of communication to how information flows, to homeostatic cycles, babies, trees, and seasons.\nThese influences, diverse as they are, coalesced into a hypothesis that agency was far more widespread and adaptable than I had ever imagined: regardless of any degrees of intelligence, composition or origin, what dictates relationships could shape a new understanding for relating.\nCould agency and interaction be part of something hidden in plain sight?\nOur senses may not tell us entirely what reality is, but from interdisciplinary experimental evidence to theoretical foundations, we can explore how agency and interaction relate. In pursuit of an explanation for why things interact, implies the assumption that some form of enabling devices for the such could be recognisable, allowing connections, which if true, their understanding could improve our knowledge of design principles for thriving across scales.\nThis required a shift in perspective, one that takes hyper-specialised notions within these scales to across them, and instead of getting bogged down in arguments on how they may differ, we should instead look towards all the notions and see if they ”dance”.\nOn a practical note, this study touches responsibility: We live on a planet with finite resources, a closed system. This reality demands that we think carefully about how we organize ourselves, how we design our cities, and how we develop new technologies.\nIt’s no longer enough to ask, “Does this work?”, instead we can ask, “Does this contribute to the long-term thriving of the whole system?”. It requires recognising that not all systems are necessarily optimized for some goal, and that it may be hard for us to even recognise goals in settings different from our own, but opening up to the possibility that we may be dismissing popular ideas on the interconnectedness of all things, and that is our ignorance preventing us from working towards some kind of harmony.\nThis relational perspective on agency has the potential to shift our understanding and practices to a truly integrated one supporting the natural world, and us in it.\nI see this book as a starting point for conversations that reach across disciplines, where philosophers, scientists, artists, policymakers, and citizens come together to explore the meaning of agency.\nUnder the assumption that everything impacts everything else, what if we could allow man-made systems to be aware of it? Whether those systems are cities, technologies, or policies, we might be ensuring that their next generations, artificial or otherwise, are by design built for co-evolution.\nWhile this has not always been the case, and the universe seems to be old, dangerous and weird, it also seems that systems that work together, become more than some of their parts, they persist, giving novel phenomena a chance to be.\nWhile the assumptions can be objectionable, I would like to use the gift of my brief life and the available means to explore this. As many came before me, and could not continue their work, as I hope when I’m no longer, some will also care for relationships, and be in absolute awe of the beauty our senses allows, moved by pain and curiosity, and held together by immense levels of collaboration, cooperation and remains open to the possibility that the awareness of it may have a scientific explanation.\nAs such, this book represents two years of exploration a journey through approximately 500 articles spanning philosophy, biology, artificial intelligence, sociology, and more. It has been both daunting and transformative. Along the way, I’ve come to appreciate not only the richness of the existing body of knowledge but also the gaps that remain between its parts.\nAs you read through these pages, I invite you to join me with an open mind, to explore new possibilities for understanding agency.\nTogether, we might uncover insights that not only deepen our knowledge but also help us build better relationships with one another, with our environments, and with the systems we create."
