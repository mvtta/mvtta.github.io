    "text": "Is it possible to formulate a truly generalized theory of Information?\nThe question is an open invitation to ask:\nThis deposit of interrogation points serves no purpose as an index of exploration, but for future records, I’ll keep them as an inspiration section, and reccur to it if if I find myself in need of such during this endeavor.\nStill in an introductory and relevant note of intention, it is important to state the following:\nThere is no ambition in my words to dissect all the lexicon-related interpretations or summarize previous publications. The goal of this note, and the ones that will follow, is to naively follow the threads and sprouts from the exploration itself. As part of these first attempts at independent research, the experimental nature of seeking first principles and training myself at refined thinking, proofing and argumentation, it is understandable that failure is a vertiginous eminence. I must remind myself that methodology without creativity is an arid field where nothing is found but drought and decay. Rain will only come if the intent is selfless, and the pursuit noble enough to transcend my flaws inspire collective wisdom, and contribute to all Life.\nAs a tooling system to approach the question at stake, I propose, while inviting whoever may see this open-research page to comment and contribute, the following: 1. Collect data 2. Sort data categorically 3. Experiement with visual abstraction using both Design and Lexicon approaches 3. 1 Examples will be sought across lexicon and academic domains 3. 2 Parallels will be tested visually in the time domain continuum 3. 3 Return to step 2. if necessary\n* Then plotting de abstractive objects in the time domain for sequential overview\nWhy is it useful to question something so robust as the current definitions and the distinction between Information Theories?\nAre there possibilities to further stretch it and find new fittings?\nIf the discovery of information is proven, how could it change our understanding of reality? Could misinformation become a crime? If we are not the true destination of information, what else is in the realm of Recipient/Observer, and qualifies as such? Even if nothing of value comes out of this, the model will not suffer when questioned, would only solidify its significance.\nIn my day to day I’m constantly reminded of Shannon’s Information Theory, and as starting point let’s take the axioms of the Mathematical Theory of Communication:"

    "text": "1938, Claude Shannon\n\nIntroducing the study of the fundamental limits in communication, applied to storage and transmission, for example, we refer to Claude Shannon where in 1938 he presents a beautiful, thoughtful, and elegant schematic for information as a process, drawing clear boundaries between steps.\nFrom an information source, a message X is transmitted via a medium, a signal is sent and then received, hopefully at the correct destination. Message X, to be transmitted, Claude thought that a binary encoding made sense, and the the bit as the smallest unit of information is born.\nInformation is treated with uncertainty and modeled as random variables.

    "text": "We experience education in sequential steps, closed and determined, and are given information and instructions within a perspective of the immutability of reality. “Always was, always will be”, sets a stage from where social order re-establishes itself for yet another generation.\nCurrently, education is given a high degree of importance, addressing three major domains:\n\nparalleled with some future economic value\nparamount for better future societies\nfor an x% increase amount of life-expectancy\n\nAmongst the immutability illusion, the doctrine of stability hinders and is dangerously close to the actual and permanent elimination of the core evolutionary device Humans have called learning ability.\nOf course, modernity and the Industrial Revolution required literate workers to read the manuals, efficiently operate the machines, and assemble products, ensuring the life expectancy of the growing assembly line. Before that, old clerics required new ones, creating literate minds to perpetuate the dogmatic pillars of societies.\nThese processes worked irrefutably then, and now, for a pair of decades, after two generations into the Industrial era, two wars eradicated the contextual roots that led to the newfound modernity, within the space-time continuum of existence.\nA beginning was forged, and the past obliviated.\nSo, what we have is the ‘life or death’ decision to, no matter at what cost, participate in the system that produces a panoply of static socio-economic engines.\nGiven that formal education eradicates the why question from the equations, and there is a hungry mob of militants enforcing procedures and methods as doctrines, the addition of the life or death term, Educational institutions appear to be very effective at their crucial role in Humanity’s self-destruction.\nIt’s understandable if you disagree, but entertain the thought for a moment, what supports the argument won’t take long to pass across, and does the reader have anything to lose?\n\nArgument\nWe are information processing systems, not machines, but systems, of systems of several degrees of agency. There are fantastical and mesmerizing processes of intra-systemic communication, and collaboration that address all scales and allow us to breathe out of our conscious decision stage.\n“Ah, that is just physics”, say most institutions.\n\n\n\nAltText\n\n\nLevin, M. Bioelectric networks: the cognitive glue enabling evolutionary scaling from physiology to mind. Anim Cogn 26, 1865–1891 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-023-01780-3\nSo far, the argument is, that “Education is essential for”\n\nsome future economic value\nsomehow better future societies\nx% increase amount of life-expectancy\n\nBy:\n\nRemoving doubt, the why question, from a very young age, ensuring the replication of social order and forging the tacit agreements on fundamental truths for the next generation to come\nTeaching complex systems to repeat the same static methods and externalizing processes, regardless of their dynamic nature\nPromising those who adhere with dedication, and precision to the set of static methodologies, a vague idea of prosperity, health and wealth\n\nOf course, the argument is not fully complete, but is important to juxtapose the information and lay the concurrent principles.\nIt is important to say at this point, that I do not argue that education is bad, nor am I defending illiteracy, child mortality and poverty. The argument defends Education at its root, the why of which education itself exists, sets the tone for further analysis on the meaning propelling this perversion, leading to the institutionalization of what once was considered a duty, and is now turning it into a privilege, for the privilege of being able to exercise it.\nTransferring the information gathered to new generations, to optimize the learning process across long periods, inter-generational learning one may call it, seems to be an evolutionary mechanism developed to prevent extinction, as most life forms on our planet contain. Most species do it in ways we haven’t been able to decode, as each system is limited by its perceptual range.\nRecapping, our education system:\nEducation is essential for:\n\nsome future economic value\nbetter future societies\nx% increase amount of life-expectancy\n\nBy:\n\nRemoving doubt, the why, from a very young age, ensuring social order and forging tacit agreements of fundamental truths\nTeaching complex systems to repeat the same methods and processes on the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the universe\nPromissing those who adhere with dedication and precision and hypothetical better future, based on static doctrines and inductive biases.\nBeing accessible exclusively for a discriminatory and deficient assessment of human potential\nUsed as an ordering power weapon\nObscuring and obstructing knowledge\nProprietary\n\nEvolution has its selection method, beyond Darwin’s linearity. Humans decided to implement Educational systems in place that select who are the fittest by the wrong criteria, hindering the evolutionary process at its core, reducing its agency to -1 device, which took millions of years to evolve.\nHumans did it in 100 years.\nIt’s unfathomable that we didn’t conceive seriously, at any period, that we know of, to question the nature of learning, why do we learn?\nI’m not an expert (break, to be continued )"

Can be tagged finished or work-in-progress.\nPoems: Self-explanatory.\nInfix: Pointers and pins, an index to my current mind map of ideas and references.
